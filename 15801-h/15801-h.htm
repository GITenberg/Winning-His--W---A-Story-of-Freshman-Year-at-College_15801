<h3>PREFACE<a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a></h3>

<p>In this book I have endeavored to relate the story
of a boy's early experiences in college life&mdash;a boy
who was neither unnaturally good nor preternaturally
bad, wholesome, earnest, impulsive, making just
such mistakes as a normal boy would make, and yet
earnest, sincere, and healthy. We all have known
just such boys and are grateful that they are neither
uncommon nor unknown.</p>

<p>Perhaps it may add a little to the interest of this
tale if it is stated that many of the events described
in it actually occurred. I have not tagged a "moral"
upon it, for if the story itself shall not bear its own
moral, then the addition will not add to it.</p>

<h4>THE OPENING TERM</h4>


<p>"I've got a letter from Peter John."</p>

<p>"What's the trouble with him? He ought to
have been here yesterday or the day before."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid Peter John never'll be on time. He
doesn't seem to have taken that in his course. He'd
never pass an 'exam' in punctuality."</p>

<p>"What does he want?"</p>

<p>"The poor chap begs us to meet him at the station."</p>

<p>"What train?"</p>

<p>"The two-seventeen."</p>

<p>"Then we've no time to waste. Is he afraid he'll
be lost?"</p>

<p>"He's afraid, all right."</p>

<p>"What's he afraid of?"</p>

<p>"Everything and everybody, I guess. Poor chap."</p>

<p>Will Phelps laughed good-naturedly as he spoke,
and it was evident that his sympathy for "Peter
John" was genuine. His friend and room-mate, Foster
Bennett, was as sympathetic as he, though his
manner was more quiet and his words were fewer;
their fears for their friend were evidently based
upon their own personal knowledge.</p>

<p>For four years the three young men had been
classmates in the Sterling High School, and in the<a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>
preceding June had graduated from its course of
study, and all three had decided to enter Winthrop
College. The entrance examinations had been successfully
passed, and at the time when this story
opens all had been duly registered as students in the
incoming class of the college.</p>

<p>Foster Bennett and Will Phelps were to be room-mates,
and for several days previous to the September
day on which the conversation already recorded
had taken place they had been in the little college
town, arranging their various belongings in the room
in Perry Hall, one of the best of all the dormitory
buildings. The first assembling of the college
students was to occur on the morrow, and then the
real life upon which they were about to enter was to
begin.</p>

<p>The two boys had come to Winthrop together, the
parents of both having decided that it was better to
throw the young students at once upon their own resources
rather than to accompany them, reserving
their visits for a later time when the first novelty of
the new life would be gone.</p>

<p>And on this September day the novelty certainly
was the most prominent element in the thoughts of
both boys. The task of arranging their various belongings
in their new rooms had kept both so busy
that thoughts of the homes they had left were of
necessity somewhat rare, and the vision of the family
life in which they had been so vital a part had not
as yet come to take the place in their minds which it
soon would occupy.</p>

<p>At the hotel where they had been staying there
were many other boys who were in a predicament not
<a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a>unlike their own, but the very fact that all were alike
new to the life and its surroundings had made every
one somewhat diffident and the warm friendships and
cordial relations that soon were to be formed were
as yet not begun.</p>

<p>Will Phelps and Foster Bennett, however, had
been so completely taken up with their own immediate
tasks that they had little thought for other things.
At the time when this story opens their study room
was ready for callers, as Will expressed it, and the
adjoining sleeping rooms were in a fair way for occupancy.
Indeed, the boys planned that very night
to sleep in the dormitory, and the experience was
looked forward to as one which they both would enjoy.</p>

<p>Will Phelps, a sturdy young fellow of eighteen, of
medium height, with strong body and a bright, keen
expression in his dark eyes, had been the most popular
of all the boys in the high school from which he
had recently graduated. Not over-fond of study, he
had somewhat neglected his tasks until his final year,
and though he had then begun to work more seriously,
his late effort had not entirely atoned for the
neglect of the preceding years. An only son and not
rigidly trained in his home, he had not formed the
habits of study which his more serious-minded
room-mate, Foster Bennett, possessed. But almost
every one who met the young student was drawn to
him by the fascination of his winning ways, and realized
at once the latent possibilities for good or ill
that were his. His success would depend much upon
his surroundings, and though Will was sublimely confident
in his ability to meet and master whatever op<a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a>posed
him, it nevertheless had been a source of deep
satisfaction to his father and mother that he was to
room with his classmate, Foster Bennett, for Foster
was of a much more sedate disposition than his
friend. Taller than Will by three inches, as fond
as he of certain athletic sports, still Foster was one
whom enthusiasm never carried away nor impulse
controlled. When people spoke of him they often
used the word "steady" to describe him. Not so
quick nor so brilliant as Will, he was not able to
arouse the response which his room-mate seldom failed
to elicit, nor was his promise in certain ways so
great. Will might do brilliant things, but of Foster
it was said that 'one always knew where to find
him.' Naturally, the two boys in a measure complemented
each other, and their friendship was strong
and lasting.</p>

<p>Peter John Schenck&mdash;no one ever thought of referring
to him by another term than "Peter John"&mdash;the
third member of the high-school class to which
reference has already been made, was a boy who
every morning had driven into the little city of
Sterling from his country home, and in his general
appearance was decidedly unlike either of his classmates.
The influences of his home had been of a
different character from those which had surrounded
his two friends. Not that the love for him had
been less, but certain elements of refinement had
been lacking and his familiarity with the ways of
the world was much less. Besides, his father had
been in humbler circumstances, and Peter John was
to room in college in Leland Hall, one of the oldest
of the dormitories, where the room rent was much
<a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a>less than in Perry Hall and more in accord with
Peter John's pocket. In school he had been made
the butt of many a joke, but his fund of good nature
had never rebelled and his persistence was never
broken. Tall, ungainly, his trousers seemed to be
in a perpetual effort to withdraw as far as possible
from his boots, while his hands and wrists apparently
were continually striving to evade the extremities
of his coat sleeves. His face was freckled, not
the ordinary freckles produced by the heat of the
sun, but huge splotches that in color almost matched
his auburn-tinted hair&mdash;at least his sister was prone
to declare that the color of his hair was "auburn,"
though his less reverent schoolmates were accustomed
to refer to him as a "brick-top."</p>

<p>But Peter John was undeterred by the guying of
his mates, and when he had first declared his intention
to go to college his words had been received
as a joke. But it was soon discovered that in whatever
light they might be received by others, to Peter
John himself they were the expression of a fixed
purpose; and so it came to pass that he too had
passed the entrance examinations and was duly enrolled
as a member of the freshman class in Winthrop
College.</p>

<p>When his determination had been accepted by
his mates, some of them had made use of their opportunities
to enlarge upon the perils that lay before
him&mdash;perils for the most part from the terrible
sophomores who were supposed to be going about
seeking their prey with all the fierceness of a roaring
lion. Peter John had listened to the marvelous
tales that were poured into his ears, but so far as
<a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>his expression of face was concerned, apparently
they had been without effect. Nevertheless, deep
in his heart Peter John had stored them all and
his fear of the class above him had increased until
at last just before he departed from home he had
written to his friend Will Phelps informing him of
his fears and begging that he and Foster would
meet him at the station and protect him from the
fierce onslaughts, which, he confessed, he expected
would await him upon his arrival. This letter Will
Phelps had found at the little post office when he
made inquiries for his mail, and upon his return
to his room it had provided the basis for the conversation
already recorded.</p>

<p>"We'd better go right down to the station, then,
Will," Foster had said.</p>

<p>"All right. Peter John will be in mortal terror
if he shouldn't find us there. He probably believes
the sophs will have a brass band and knives and
guns and will be drawn up on the platform ready
to grab him just the minute he steps off the car."</p>

<p>"Not quite so bad as that," laughed Foster. "But
we'll have to help the poor chap out."</p>

<p>"Sure. Come on, then," called Will as he seized
his cap and started toward the hallway.</p>

<p>"Hold on a minute. Wait till I lock the door."</p>

<p>"'Lock the door?' Not much! You mustn't do
that."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"It isn't polite."</p>

<p>"What are you talking about?" demanded Foster.</p>

<p>"Just what I'm telling you. Freshmen mustn't
lock their doors, that's not the thing. The janitor
<a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>told me not to, because the sophs will take it as a
challenge to break it in. He said the college had
to put sixty new locks this summer on the doors
here in Perry."</p>

<p>"Looks as if something had happened for a fact,"
said Foster slowly, as he glanced at some huge
cracks that were plainly visible in the panels. "Sure
't'll be safe?"</p>

<p>"It'll be all right. The janitor says so. Come on!
Come on, or we'll be too late!"</p>

<p>The two boys ran swiftly down the stairway
(their room was on the third floor of the dormitory)
and soon were on the street which was directly in
front of the building. As they walked rapidly in
the direction of the station, which was a half-mile
or more distant from the college buildings, the sight
which greeted their eyes was one that stirred the
very depths of their hearts. The very buildings
themselves were impressive, some old and antiquated,
dating back a century or more and venerable
with age, and others new and beautiful, the recent
gifts of some loyal alumni. From the huge clock
in the tower of the chapel rang out the chimes
which announced that the hour of two was come and
gone. The beautifully kept grounds, the stately
buildings, the very leaves on the huge elms that grew
about the grounds were all impressive at the time
to the boys to whom the entire picture was new.</p>

<p>In the wide street that led directly through the
midst of the college buildings, were passing young
men of their own age, some of whom would suddenly
stop and grasp with fervor the hands of some
students just returned from the long summer vaca<a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>tion.
From the windows of the dormitories could
be seen the faces of students who were leaning far
out and shouting their words of greeting to friends
on the street below. The September sun was warm
and mellow, and as it found its way through the
thick foliage it also cast fantastic shadows upon
the grass that seemed to dance and leap in the very
contagion of the young life that abounded on every
side. The very air was almost electric and the
high hills in the distance that shut in the valley
and provided a framework for the handiwork of
nature, lent an additional charm to which Will
Phelps was unconsciously responding.</p>

<p>"I tell you, Foster, this is great! I'm glad I'm
here!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Are you?" replied Foster in his more subdued
manner. "Well, I'm glad too."</p>

<p>The scene upon the platform of the station was as
animated and inspiring as that about the college
grounds. Groups of students were here awaiting
the coming of friends, and yet their impatience was
hidden by the enthusiasm of the moment. One group,
consisting of twenty or more young men, particularly
interested Will, for their noise and exuberance
seemed to know no bounds. At last a young man,
evidently a student though slightly older than the
most in the group, approached them and said: "Here,
you sophs! You're making too much noise. Children
should be seen, not heard."</p>

<p>"All right, pop," responded one; and for a time
the noise decreased. But it was not long before it
broke forth afresh and became even more violent
than before. Both Will and Foster were curiously
<a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a>watching the group; they almost instinctively looked
upon them as natural enemies and yet were compelled
to laugh at their antics.</p>

<p>"Here you, taxi-driver," suddenly called out one
of the sophomores advancing from the midst of his
classmates and approaching one of the cabs, a line of
which were drawn up near the platform.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Here you are! Here you
are! This way!" responded a half-dozen of the
taxi-drivers.</p>

<p>"Be still!" replied the young man solemnly to the
noisy men. "Can't you see I'm engaged with John?
Now, John, tell me honestly, are you free?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Take you anywhere ye say,"
responded the driver glibly.</p>

<p>"You're sure you're at liberty?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"All right, then. I'm glad to hear it. I've a
great respect for liberty. That's all I wanted to
know; thank you," he added, politely bowing; then
turning to his classmates he said: "I say, fellows,
make it three for liberty!"</p>

<p>The cheers were given with a will, and then the
leader added solemnly, "Let's make it three for our
class, the best class that ever entered old Winthrop!
Now then!"</p>

<p>These cheers also were loudly given, but they
ceased abruptly when it was seen that the train,
for whose coming they had been waiting, was now
approaching.</p>

<h4>PETER JOHN'S ARRIVAL</h4>


<p>Before the rumbling train halted at the station,
there was a rush of students toward it, all eager
to welcome the incoming crowd, and every one apparently
being desirous of being the first to greet his
friends. Upon the platforms of the cars also crowds
of students were to be seen, waving their hats in the
air or standing with their traveling bags in their
hands, all as eager as the boys at the station to be
foremost in the reunion scene.</p>

<p>Will Phelps and his room-mate stood a little back
from the assembly and watched the proceedings with
an interest which neither could conceal. It was all
so stimulating, this animation and bustle and manifest
eagerness in renewing the college life, and to
feel that they too were to have a share in the possessions
of these young men, scarcely one of whom
was known to them personally, was in itself sufficient
to quicken their pulses and arouse all the
dormant forces of their nature. The train was a
long one and yet from every car came pouring forth
the stream of students and the excitement continued
for several minutes.</p>

<p>Suddenly a shout went up from the crowd and
there was a rush of students toward the rear car.
"There's Baker! Good old Sam! Hurrah for the
captain!" were among the cries that could be heard
as the students surged toward the platform, from
which a sturdy young man could be seen descending,
apparently unmindful of the interest his coming had
<a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a>aroused and striving to be indifferent to the cheers
that greeted his arrival.</p>

<p>Will Phelps and Foster Bennett almost unconsciously
moved with the throng though they were not
fully aware of the cause of the sudden interest of
the students. "It may be that he's the captain of
the football team," said Will in a low voice to his
companion. "At any rate the captain's name is
Baker and probably this is the man."</p>

<p>Foster nodded his head but made no other reply
as he stood watching the young man as he stepped
down from the platform. There could be no question
as to who he was, for the conquering hero was
writ large upon his powerful frame and the universal
deference of the student body could be
accounted for only by the fact that a leader in Winthrop
had arrived.</p>

<p>"Look there, Will," said Foster suddenly. "There's
Peter John."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Right behind Baker. Just coming out of the
door. See him?"</p>

<p>"Yes," responded Will as he obtained a glimpse
of his classmate just as he was emerging from the
doorway. Travel-stained, his hat pushed back on
his head, his eyes wildly staring about at the crowd,
a huge carpet-bag in his hand, his appearance certainly
would have attracted the attention of the
spectators had it not been that their interest was apparently
centered in the mighty captain of the football
team and they had no thought for any one else.</p>

<p>Just as Baker stepped down, Peter John emerged
from the car directly behind the captain, and a cheer
<a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a>louder than any that before had been given rose
from the assembly.</p>

<p>Poor Peter John! Nervous and excited, conscious
only of himself and his strange surroundings, the
startled freshman had no other thought than that the
cheers were meant for him and doubtless were intended
as a war cry from those enemies of whom he
had heard such marvelous tales&mdash;the sophomores.
Wild-eyed, for a moment he seemed to be well-nigh
paralyzed. He stood motionless and gazed out at
the surging mass of students almost as if he were
minded to turn back into the car and escape from
the threatening peril. But the pressure from behind
was too strong to permit him to carry out his intention
and he was compelled to move forward. As yet
he had not seen his two waiting friends and his
feeling of utter loneliness swept over him afresh.
From the lowest step he was about to move when
another mighty shout went up from the assembly
and Peter John looked helplessly about him as if
he were convinced that his doom was sealed and
for him there was to be no escape.</p>

<p>Suddenly he darted from the midst of the crowd,
sending two or three young men who chanced to be
in his way sprawling, and with his quaint carpet-bag
still tightly grasped in his hand fled directly back
over the railway ties. He had not gone far before
his flight was perceived and a shout of laughter and
derision arose. Even the mighty Baker was ignored
in the fresh excitement and instantly a crowd of
students started in pursuit of the fleeing freshman.</p>

<p>"Hi, there! Stop, freshman! Wait a minute;
we'll help carry your bag! Look at the sprinter!<a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a>
Going home? Good-bye! Good-bye!" were among
the derisive cries that he heard. There could be no
mistake, the attention of the entire student body was
upon him, he was convinced, and his speed increased.
His long legs, his flying coat tails, his flapping carpet-bag,
indeed his entire appearance was such that
shrieks of laughter arose from his pursuers, but
Peter John never once glanced behind him. Every
fresh call served to increase his terror. Life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness were about to be taken
from him and his sole hope depended upon his own
exertions. It was do or die, and Peter John preferred
the former.</p>

<p>In a brief time the good-natured crowd abandoned
its pursuit, and Peter John Schenck was left to continue
his lonely flight. Will Phelps and Foster Bennett
had joined in the laughter at first, for the
ridiculous flight of their classmate was well-nigh
irresistible; but when it soon became apparent that
Peter John's terror was real and that he firmly
believed the entire college was in swift pursuit of
him, their attitude changed.</p>

<p>"It's too bad, Will," said Foster. "The poor chap
is scared almost to death."</p>

<p>"We can't help it. He'll have to learn some things,
if not others," laughed Will.</p>

<p>"They're coming back," suggested Foster, as the
pursuit was abandoned and the students laughing
boisterously returned to the station.</p>

<p>Peter John, however, was still fleeing and his long
strides and his wildly flapping carpet-bag could be
distinctly seen as the frightened freshman sped up
the track. The body of students, however, had now
<a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a>turned into the street that led back to the college
grounds, and apparently Peter John's wild flight
was already forgotten.</p>

<p>"We must go after him," said Foster thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Oh, leave him alone," replied Will. "He'll come
back all right."</p>

<p>"You go up to the room and I'll go and look him
up."</p>

<p>"Not much! If you go, then I go too! I may be
the next victim and I don't intend to be offered up
alone. Come on, or he'll be clear back in Sterling
before we find him."</p>

<p>Will laughed as he spoke, and at once the two boys
started up the track in the direction in which their
classmate had fled. He could not be seen now for a
bend in the road had concealed him from sight, and
for a time his two friends did not dare to run, being
fearful that they too might attract an undue amount
of attention and bring upon themselves the many
ills from which they were striving to save their
friend.</p>

<p>Apparently their departure from the station had
not drawn the attention of any one, and, as they
became convinced that they were not being followed,
their own speed increased until they too had passed
the bend in the road, when they began to run swiftly.
Nothing could be seen of Peter John, and when
they had gone a considerable distance Will Phelps
stopped and whistled.</p>

<p>At first there was no response, but when the signal
had been thrice repeated both boys heard the
voice of their friend apparently coming from be<a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a>hind
the bushes growing on the bank directly beside
them.</p>

<p>"All alone, Will?" called Peter John timidly.</p>

<p>"Yes. Yes. Where are you, Peter John?" responded
Will, peering about him, but as yet unable
to determine where his friend was hiding.</p>

<p>"Here I am."</p>

<p>"Where's that?"</p>

<p>"Right here."</p>

<p>"Come out here where we are. Stand up like a
little man and be counted."</p>

<p>"Sure nobody's with you?"</p>

<p>"Foster's here, that's all."</p>

<p>Slowly Peter John arose from his hiding-place
and peered anxiously about him. "It's all right.
Come on!" called Will encouragingly. Thus bidden,
Peter John stepped forth, still holding tightly in
his grasp his precious carpet-bag. Will Phelps
did not even laugh nor did he have any inclination
to do so as he perceived how genuine was the suffering
of the terrified boy.</p>

<p>"You needn't be afraid now, Peter John," he said
soothingly. "You're all right."</p>

<p>"That was a close call."</p>

<p>"Call for what?" demanded Foster sharply. Will
turned and looked in surprise at his room-mate, for
the tone of his voice was very unlike that which he
had used when he had insisted that they should go
to the aid of their classmate.</p>

<p>"I tell you they were after me!" said Peter John,
wiping his brow with a huge handkerchief as he
spoke.<a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a>"Who were after you?" demanded Foster still
more sharply.</p>

<p>"The sophomores."</p>

<p>"Don't you believe it!"</p>

<p>"Why, they'd have got me if I hadn't put in my
prettiest."</p>

<p>"Nobody would have paid any attention to you if
you hadn't run. You drew it all on yourself and
have no one else to blame."</p>

<p>"Guess you weren't there when I landed! They
gave such a yell when I started from the cars as I
never heard before in all my born days."</p>

<p>"Did you think they were yelling for you?"</p>

<p>"Of course I did. I knew they'd be waiting for
me."</p>

<p>"Peter John, you've made a fool of yourself. There
wasn't a soul there except Will and me that knew
there was such a fellow in all the world as Peter
John Schenck. Everybody in college will know it
now, though."</p>

<p>"What made 'em yell so, then?" demanded Peter
John.</p>

<p>"They weren't yelling for you at all. They were
cheering for Baker, the captain of the football team.
He was just ahead of you."</p>

<p>"They were?"</p>

<p>"That's what I said." Foster smiled slightly as
he spoke, for the expression upon the face of Peter
John was a study. Consternation, incredulity, and
partial unbelief in what Foster had said were all
expressed there, and his entire attitude was so
indescribably ludicrous as almost to be pathetic.<a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a>"Swan! I didn't know that," he said at last
slowly.</p>

<p>"Well, you know it now."</p>

<p>"What shall I do?"</p>

<p>"'Do'? Do nothing. Just attend to your own
business and let everything else go."</p>

<p>"I thought I was attending to my own business,"
said Peter John woefully.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, never mind, Peter John," broke in Will
with a laugh. "It's all over now and no bones
broken."</p>

<p>"I wish it <i>was</i> all over," said Foster in a low voice
to Will.</p>

<p>"I wish it was too. He'll be the center of interest
by to-morrow. And really, Foster, it did beat anything
I ever saw."</p>

<p>Foster Bennett smiled but made no reply, and together
the three boys began to retrace their way to
the station. Peter John evidently was somewhat
crestfallen and seldom spoke. At the station no
students were seen, and the trio at once started up
the street toward the college.</p>

<p>"I suppose my things are in my room," Peter John
ventured to suggest.</p>

<p>"Yes, they're there all right. I went over this
morning to see about them."</p>

<p>"Thank you. I'll be pretty busy for the rest of
the days I take it."</p>

<p>"That won't do you any harm. You can come
over and sleep on the couch in our room to-night if
you would like to," suggested Foster.</p>

<p>"Are you all settled?"<a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a>"Pretty much. Enough so that we can make room
for you. There's always room for one more, you
know." Foster spoke pleasantly and Peter John
was quick to respond. They were now near the
college grounds, however, and the interest of Peter
John was quickly taken up in his surroundings.
Both Will and Foster were familiar with the name
of every building by this time, and their residence
of three days in the college town had already given
to them a sense of part possession, and they glibly
explained to their classmate the name and use of
each building as they passed it until at last they
halted before Leland Hall, where Peter John was
to have his room.</p>

<p>"I'd like to know who's to be my room-mate," he
said as all three turned into the low entry and
began to mount the worn stairway.</p>

<p>"Probably he's thinking of the same thing too,"
laughed Will. "Here you are," he added as he stopped
before the door of a room on the third floor. "Yours
is twenty-six, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, here it is."</p>

<p>"Come on in, fellows," urged Peter John, opening
the door as he spoke, and all three found themselves
in the presence of a young man of their own
age, who glanced quickly up from the box which he
was unpacking as they entered.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h3>

<h4>NEW FRIENDS AND NEW EXPERIENCES</h4>


<p>"One of you, I fancy, is Schenck, who is to room
here with me. I haven't the remotest idea which
one of you is the man, but whichever it is I'm glad
to see him."</p>

<p>The young man laughed heartily as he spoke, and
all three of the freshmen laughed in response so contagious
was his good nature. But his appearance
was even more striking than his words, for he
stood before them like a young giant. He was at
least six feet and three inches in height, his shoulders
were so broad that they made the very doorway
appear narrow, and as he stood before them without
his coat and with his shirt sleeves rolled back over
his arms, the great knots of muscles could be plainly
seen. Altogether he presented a most impressive
sight, and his young classmates were duly impressed
by his huge size and evident physical strength.</p>

<p>"I'm Schenck," said Peter John, after a momentary
hesitation.</p>

<p>"Glad to see you," exclaimed the young giant,
stepping forward and grasping his room-mate's hand
in such a manner as to make Peter John wince. "You
know what my name is, I suppose. I'm Hawley.
'Cupe' Hawley they called me in school because I
was such a dainty and delicate little specimen." And
again his laughter broke forth. "Friends of yours,
Schenck?" he added, as he glanced inquiringly at
the two companions of his room-mate.</p>

<p>Will Phelps and Foster Bennett were at once
<a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a>introduced, and warmly greeted their classmate.</p>

<p>"Sorry I can't offer you any seats, fellows," said
Hawley, still laughing, though there was no apparent
cause for his enjoyment. "Haven't got everything
unpacked yet; but if you'll just wait a minute we'll
find something for you to sit on."</p>

<p>"We'll help you," said Will Phelps, at once laying
aside his coat.</p>

<p>In their room he and Foster had done but little
of the labor required in unpacking their belongings,
for neither had been accustomed to such tasks in
the homes from which they had come. Their fathers
both were well-to-do and it had not occurred to either
of the boys that the manual labor in settling their
room was something to be expected of them. For
a moment Foster glanced quizzically at his friend
as if he was puzzled to account for his unexpected
proffer, but knowing Will's impulsiveness as he did
he was quick to respond, and in a brief time the
few belongings of Peter John and his room-mate
were unpacked and the beds were set up, the shades
at the windows, and the few scanty belongings all
arranged.</p>

<p>"I didn't bring a carpet. Did you?" inquired
Hawley of Schenck.</p>

<p>"No," replied Peter John.</p>

<p>"We can get along without one. I haven't any
money to spare, and carpets are luxuries anyway.
If we feel like it we can buy one afterwards. They're
dangerous things though," and Hawley laughed as
he spoke. "My doctor says they're the worst sources
of contagion in the world, and whatever else I do
I must be careful of my health." Again the laugh
<a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a>of the young giant rang out, and in its contagion
all three of his classmates joined.</p>

<p>And yet as Will Phelps glanced about the room
its appearance was pitifully bare. The furniture
was of the plainest, the walls were bare of pictures,
there were none of the numerous pillows and other
tokens of the warm regard of friends that had accompanied
himself and his room-mate into the new
life upon which they had entered. Apparently, however,
Hawley was as delighted over his surroundings
as he and Foster over theirs, perhaps even
more, and Will was thoughtful for a moment as
he silently watched his newly made friend.</p>

<p>"How did you happen to come to Winthrop?" he
inquired at last when the task of settling the room
was measurably complete and all four had seated
themselves on the rude wooden chairs which made
up most of the furnishings of the room.</p>

<p>"I didn't 'happen' to come." Somehow everything
appeared to be a source of enjoyment to Hawley,
and questions or remarks were alike greeted
with a laugh.</p>

<p>"What made you, then?"</p>

<p>"Isn't Winthrop the best college in the United
States?" demanded Hawley.</p>

<p>"Yes, or at least that's what my father thinks.
He graduated here and it may be that his opinion is
a little prejudiced. Is that why you came?"</p>

<p>"Partly." Again Hawley laughed and closed one
eye as he spoke.</p>

<p>"I can give a guess what the other reason was,"
said Foster.<a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a>"What was it?"</p>

<p>"Football."</p>

<p>Hawley laughed loudly this time as he replied,
"You're 'a very Daniel come to judgment.' That's
from the 'Merchant of Venice,' isn't it? Well, if it
is, it's about all I remember of my English course.
Well, I'll be honest with you. I did see Baker this
summer, and he set before me the advantages of
coming to Winthrop in such a way that I couldn't
very well say no. And I didn't, so here I am."</p>

<p>"Did he offer to pay you?" demanded Peter John.</p>

<p>"Did he offer <i>what?</i>" demanded Hawley.</p>

<p>Somewhat abashed Peter John did not repeat his
question, and his room-mate at once turned the
conversation into other lines. "We had a pretty
good football team in the academy where I fitted
for college, and there were several colleges, or at
least the football men of the college, who seemed
to be quite willing that some of our fellows should
go to them. We had a half-back who was a dandy!
His name was Patrick O'Hara, and he passed better
in football than he did in any other subject in the
course." And Hawley stopped to laugh at the
recollection of his former fellow-student. "Pat
wasn't very much of a hand to study, and when one
of the men from White College suggested to him
that he should come there, why Pat was delighted.
'What studies will you take?' asked the fellow, for
you see he knew without being told that Pat wouldn't
be valedictorian of his class whatever other honor
he might take, and he was trying to make it easy
for him. 'Well,' said Pat, ''bedad, an' if it's all th'
same t' yez, I'm thinkin' I'll just be afther takin' a
<a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a>bit o' the spellin' an' perhaps a bit o' figurin'. How
do thot be afther suitin' yez'?"</p>

<p>All the boys joined in the laugh with which Hawley
related the story, and Will Phelps said, "Where
did Pat go?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Hawley slowly, "he has gone to
White College."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say he has <i>entered</i> there?" demanded
Will.</p>

<p>"That's what they tell me, though I've a notion
he'll come out the same door he went in, and he
won't tarry long either. Probably soon after the
season ends."</p>

<p>"But we play White College. It's one of our nearest
rivals," suggested Will. "But then," he added,
"that's just like them. They never do a thing on
the square anyway!"</p>

<p>Hawley pursed his lips as if he was about to
whistle, but he did not speak though his eyes twinkled
with merriment as if Will's statement somehow
was hugely enjoyed by him. Foster Bennett
noticing the expression on Hawley's face, also
laughed, but he did not reply to his room-mate's
very positive declaration. There were some things
which Will could not understand, for with his intense
and impulsive disposition the one thing which
impressed him at the time was capable of only one
interpretation. His confidence in Winthrop and his
dislike of its rival college were therefore only what
were to be expected of his friend.</p>

<p>"Obliged to you, fellows," said Hawley, as Will
Phelps and Foster Bennett rose to depart. "Come
in and see us often."<a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a>"You'll see enough of us from now on," responded
Will as he and his room-mate departed.</p>

<p>As the two passed out into the street and returned
to their own room Foster said, "It's pretty bare
there in Leland, isn't it, Will?"</p>

<p>"Yes. They both seem to be happy though."</p>

<p>"Not much like our room."</p>

<p>"No. But then, Foster, you see they don't know
the difference."</p>

<p>Foster smiled but made no response, and Will
continued. "You see everything in this world is
relative. A man doesn't miss what he never had,
does he?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps not."</p>

<p>"Now look here, Foster. Do you think a blind
man suffers because he can't see? I mean a man
who was born blind, of course."</p>

<p>"What then?"</p>

<p>"Why, the man I'm sorry for is the one that could
see once and has lost his sight. He knows, let me
tell you, what he's lost. But the other man doesn't
appreciate it. He never could see, so he couldn't
lose his sight, could he? Tell me that."</p>

<p>"So you wouldn't do anything to help him?"</p>

<p>"I didn't say that. I didn't say that at all. All
I say is that the fellow I'm sorry for is the one
who has had and lost, not the one who never had.
Now look at Peter John, and Hawley. Their room
isn't so good as ours, but it probably is just as good
as they expected, or have been used to, so they
don't suffer any."<a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a>"And if you and I had to put up with their room&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, we'd feel it."</p>

<p>"It's a mighty comfortable way of looking at
things, that's all I have to say."</p>

<p>"But it's the true way," said Will glibly. "There's
one thing I'm mighty glad of for Peter John's sake."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"That he rooms with Hawley. I don't believe the
sophs will bother him very much."</p>

<p>"Not when Hawley's on hand."</p>

<p>"You think they will when he's not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I do. Peter John just invites them. It
stands right out on his face."</p>

<p>"Sort of a standing invitation, so to speak?"
laughed Will Phelps. "Well, for my part, I hope
he won't be too fresh. There's everything in that,
you know."</p>

<p>"And therefore we'll go scot free?"</p>

<p>"Well, Hawley is a great fellow anyway; and I'm
glad he's in our class."</p>

<p>"He's big, anyway."</p>

<p>"That's what I said."</p>

<p>"No you didn't, you said great."</p>

<p>"Same thing."</p>

<p>"Not much. A man can be big without being
great, can't he? Caesar and Napoleon were not big
men, but I think you'd sum up that they were
great."<a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a>"Great butchers, if that's what you mean. You
always spin it out too fine for me, Foster."</p>

<p>Foster Bennett laughed and both boys entered
their room to prepare for dinner. They still were
taking their meals at the hotel, as their boarding-place
had not been selected. In the thoughts of
both it was a selection of too much importance to
be made hastily, and they were therefore waiting
until they became more familiar with the details of
their new life.</p>

<p>It was all novel and interesting, and on the following
day the first class meeting was held. A dignified
junior presided at the meeting, and after explaining
what was expected and that the class officers
to be selected were to serve only for a month,
when it was thought that the members of the class
would have become sufficiently acquainted with one
another to enable them to act with becoming wisdom,
he called for nominations for class president.</p>

<p>Peter John Schenck immediately arose and said,
"I nominate Hawley."</p>

<p>The nomination was seconded, and there were
calls for Hawley to step to the platform and stand
where all the class could see him. The young giant
obediently advanced and taking his place beside
Spencer, who also was nominated for the office,
awaited the verdict. There were cheers when it was
announced that Hawley had won, and the junior
then called for nominations for secretary and
treasurer.</p>

<p>Again Peter John arose to the occasion and said,
"I nominate Phelps."<a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a>Will's face flushed scarlet at the unexpected words
but his room-mate at once had seconded the nomination,
and he was compelled to advance to the platform
and stand beside Farmer and McVey, whose
names were also presented for the same office. There
was some confusion for a time, but quiet was restored
when the result of the ballot was announced.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<h4>A CLOUD OF WITNESSES</h4>


<p>Will Phelps had been elected temporary secretary
and treasurer of his class, the choice having been
made chiefly because his appearance, as he stood
on the platform, pleased his classmates, and not because
of any general acquaintance that had been
formed. And yet his election had brought him at
once into a certain prominence, and doubtless Will
was duly appreciative of the honor bestowed upon
him.</p>

<p>The member of the junior class to whom had been
entrusted the organizing of the freshmen now rose
to give some general words of advice before the
meeting was adjourned. "There are some things
in college," he was saying, "that have the force of
laws. Some of them will appear foolish to you, it may
be, and yet it will be more foolish to disregard them.
For example, freshmen are not expected to go up
to the hotel parlors in the evening, it would be
decidedly better for them not to display on their
caps or jersey the letters or numerals of the schools
from which they have come, and they must not tack
their cards on the doors of their rooms." Walker,
the junior, continued his directions until he thought
he had covered most of the details of the life upon
which the incoming class was entering, but his remarks
were not completed when Peter John Schenck
arose from his seat and stood facing the president.
There was a momentary pause as Walker ceased
<a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a>speaking, and the eyes of all the class were turned
toward Peter John.</p>

<p>After due deliberation, Peter John said in a loud
voice, "Mr. President, I move that we adjourn."</p>

<p>The hush that followed was broken by a loud
laugh which had been started by Walker himself.
Peter John, however, glanced about the room as if
he was unable to perceive what it was that had
caused the outbreak. Apparently unabashed, he
again turned to the class president and said, "Isn't
a motion to adjourn always in order, Mr. President?
If it is, then I repeat my former motion. I move
that we adjourn."</p>

<p>Hawley was too good-natured to treat the interruption
as it deserved, so he said, "Is the motion
seconded?"</p>

<p>Apparently it was not, and still unabashed, Peter
John again took his seat while Walker resumed his
remarks.</p>

<p>"I don't know that I have anything more to say,
only to tell you fellows to be careful. College traditions
and customs have all the force of laws, and
though some of them may seem to be foolish, still
I believe in the main they help to make the life here
what it is, and that's what you all want to get. If
you have any questions to ask, don't be afraid to
come to me with them, or to any of the juniors,
and you'll be given all we know, which, though I
can promise you it may not be much, still may be
just a little more than you know. Or, perhaps,
some of you," he added, glancing quizzically in the
direction of Peter John Schenck as he spoke.</p>

<p>When Walker departed from the room, Peter John
<a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a>was again the first to arise. "I move we adjourn,"
he said in a loud voice.</p>

<p>"Second the motion," said Foster Bennett quickly.
The motion was put and instantly carried, and the
class passed out from the room.</p>

<p>"It was anything to shut up Peter John," Foster
explained to Will as he joined his room-mate. "Did
you ever see the like?"</p>

<p>"I never did," laughed Will. "I feel almost guilty
to be acting as secretary for the class. If we had
ten other offices to vote upon, I believe Peter John
would have made the first nomination for every
one."</p>

<p>"He certainly is the freshest freshman in the
whole bunch."</p>

<p>"Yes, he doesn't know enough to know that he
doesn't know, and that's about as far down as a
fellow can go in his ignorance, you know."</p>

<p>"What shall we do for him?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"But he'll have trouble."</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>"I'd hate to see him catch it too hard."</p>

<p>"You can't save him, Foster. He's got to learn
his lesson. The idea of his being on his feet so
much to-day."</p>

<p>"Well, he helped us to some good officers anyway,
I'll say that much for him," laughed Foster. "But
if he made such an impression on our class, what'll
he do for the sophomores?"</p>

<p>"You'd better be thinking about what they'll do
for him."<a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a>Walker now joined the two boys, introducing
himself to each, and accompanying them to their
room, where he entered and took a seat at their
invitation. He was a fine-looking young man and
of most agreeable manners, so that soon both Will
and Foster were delighted with him personally and
appreciative of the honor of the visit from their
visitor.</p>

<p>"No," Walker was saying, "the hazing doesn't
amount to anything much in Winthrop. It's nothing
more than a little good-natured 'horse play' for the
most part. Of course, once in a while a fellow gets
a little more attention than the rest of the class;
but as a rule it's his own fault. You have a classmate
that'll be very popular with the sophs, if he
doesn't look out," he added with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Who's that?" inquired Will, with a wink at his
room-mate.</p>

<p>"The chap that was on his feet so much in the
class meeting this afternoon."</p>

<p>"We were just talking about him," said Foster
quickly. "You know he fitted at the same school
where we did, and naturally we want to lend him a
hand when we can. What had we better do?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Just what I say. You can't do much for such a
fellow; he has to learn it all for himself. The trouble
is that he doesn't know how much or what he's
got to learn yet. You can't do much for such a&mdash;"</p>

<p>Walker stopped abruptly as Peter John himself
entered the room. His face was beaming, and as he
removed his hat his stiff red hair seemed almost
<a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a>to rise on his head. "Well, fellows," he said, "we
did things up brown this afternoon, didn't we?"</p>

<p>"You did too much," said Walker quietly.</p>

<p>"Haven't I as good a right as anybody to make a
motion?" demanded Peter John hotly.</p>

<p>"You have as much right, but you don't want always
to take all your rights, you know."</p>

<p>"Why not? I'll stand up for my rights every
time. Now, I don't believe a word of what you said
this afternoon."</p>

<p>"You're complimentary; but you're under no obligations
to believe me," laughed Walker.</p>

<p>"I don't mean just that. What I mean is that I'd
like to see the sophomore who'd tell me what I could
wear or what I couldn't; or where I could go and
where I couldn't. He hasn't anything to say about
that."</p>

<p>"He thinks he has," suggested Walker quietly.</p>

<p>"I don't care what he thinks. I know my rights,
and I intend to stand up for them too!"</p>

<p>"Is that why you were running up the railroad
track the day when you came to Winthrop?" demanded
Will Phelps.</p>

<p>"Never you mind about that!" retorted Peter John
in nowise abashed. "That was when I didn't know
as much as I do now."</p>

<p>"Three or four days will do great things for a
fellow," remarked Walker dryly.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, that's so. You're right about that,"
acknowledged Peter John graciously. "Say, fellows,
what are you going to do about these Greek letter
societies?" he inquired abruptly, turning to his two
classmates as he spoke.<a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a>Both Will Phelps and Foster Bennett glanced uneasily
at Walker, but the junior only smiled and
made no response. It was apparent though that the
topic Peter John had broached was one upon which
all three had been conferring.</p>

<p>"We haven't done anything as yet," said Foster.</p>

<p>"Neither have I," acknowledged Peter John. "I
thought I'd take my time before I decided which one
I'd join. I suppose I'll have to write home to pa,
but he won't know as much about it as I do."</p>

<p>"We live and learn," said Walker as he rose to
depart. "I'll see you to-night?" he inquired of Will
and Foster as he stopped for a moment in the doorway.
Will glanced questioningly at his room-mate
and then said: "Thank you, Walker. We'll be
very glad to come."</p>

<p>"Where you going? What did he want?" demanded
Peter John when Walker was gone.</p>

<p>"It was something personal," said Foster. "Walker
thinks you'll have to walk the chalk line, Peter
John, or you'll have trouble with the sophs."</p>

<p>"He does, does he? Well, I'll show him. I'd like
to know what right they've got to tell me what to
do. I'll do as I please! My chum&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was instantly plain to the boys now the cause
for this sudden and strange change in Peter John's
attitude. He was relying upon the prowess of Hawley
to protect him now and apparently was confident
that he would not be molested since he roomed with
the young giant whose name already was known
throughout the college and from whom such great
things were expected for the football team.</p>

<p>"Don't depend too much upon Hawley! He can't
<a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a>be everywhere, remember," said Foster warningly.</p>

<p>"I'll show 'em, if they come near me!" retorted
Peter John as he departed.</p>

<p>For several days the college life went on quietly
and the boys were becoming somewhat accustomed
to their new surroundings. There had been a
"sweater rush" between the two lower classes, in
which Hawley had been entrusted with the precious
sweater, and, surrounded by his classmates, successfully
defended it against the onslaught of the sophomores.
The struggle had been severe but in good
part, and the worst results had been some torn
clothing and bruised faces. The freshmen wore
upon their arms a strip of white cloth to enable
them to distinguish their own comrades, and great
was their elation when after the time limit had
expired, it was discovered that the coveted sweater
was unharmed. The strength of Hawley had been
as the strength of ten and his praises were in every
mouth.</p>

<p>Into this struggle Will Phelps had thrown himself
with all his might, and when he joyfully emerged
from the struggling mass of humanity gathered
about Hawley his rejoicing was great and his cheers
for the class were among the loudest.</p>

<p>On the border of the crowd he had perceived
Peter John, but his classmate displayed no evidence
of the recent struggle and Will was about to question
him, when Peter John himself said, "Come over to
my room to-night, Will."</p>

<p>"All right." Will Phelps had promised readily,
and then the matter departed from his mind as he
rushed about among his classmates.<a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a>That evening he suddenly glanced up from the
book he was studying and said to his room-mate:
"Foster, I agreed to go over to Peter John's room
to-night. Want to go?"</p>

<p>"Can't say that I'm pining for it. What does he
want?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. He seemed to be very much in
earnest about it, though."</p>

<p>"Is it much nearer from here to his room than it
is from his room to ours? If he wanted to see you
so much, why didn't he come over here?"</p>

<p>"That isn't Peter John's way," laughed Will. "I
promised to go, so I think I'll run over for a
minute. I'll be back pretty soon."</p>

<p>"If you need me let me know," called Foster
as Will departed, and he then at once resumed his
task.</p>

<p>Will Phelps ran across the campus to Leland Hall,
and as he turned in at the dimly lighted hall the
contrast between his own surroundings and those in
which he now found himself was for the moment
almost painful. The stone step at the entrance had
been worn away by the passing of boyish feet over
it for more than a century. For a moment there
flashed into his mind the thought of the eager lives
that there had been trained and long since had
passed over into the land beyond. Will himself
was the fourth generation in direct descent in his
own family to enter Winthrop, and as he now passed
slowly up the rough, narrow, and worn stairway,
he found himself thinking of his own father and
grandfather and great-grandfather, all of whom
doubtless had many a time been in the very same
<a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a>hallway where he himself then was. Even then from
far down the street came the sounds of song and
laughter of some passing body of students and the
faint sound he could hear was for the moment almost
like the echo of long past days. The very hall
seemed to echo also with the footfalls of students
who had long since completed their course and
passed on. He was surrounded by a cloud of witnesses.</p>

<p>Suddenly from the floor above him came the sound
of noisy shouts and shrieks of laughter. The vision
of other days and other men instantly departed,
and the full force of the appeal of the present swept
over him. Bounding up the steps, two at a time,
he swiftly came to the third floor and then stopped
abruptly as the shouts were redoubled and evidently
came from Peter John Schenck's room.</p>

<p>For a moment Will hesitated, almost tempted to
turn back, but his feeling of curiosity was strong
and resolutely he advanced and rapped upon the
door. This was quickly opened and Will stepped
inside the room. The door had instantly been closed
and bolted behind him, but Will was hardly aware
of that so interested was he in the sight upon which
he gazed in the room which was filled with a noisy
group of students.</p>



<hr /><p><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a></p>
<h3><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h3>

<h4>UNSOUGHT ATTENTIONS</h4>


<p>One glance about him had been sufficient to convince
Will Phelps that his classmates were suffering
from a visit of the sophomores, a dozen or more of
whom he recognized as being in the room. He looked
quickly behind him at the door, but this already
had been closed and three of the stalwart sophomores
were standing with their backs against it, the
others being stationed at different points about the
room. In the center stood Mott, a lusty sophomore
whom he had frequently seen and whose
general bearing he had intensely disliked, for his
face bore the unmistakable traces of dissipation and
his bearing was that of a rowdy. The fact that Mott
had secured a high position among the college athletes
had in a measure made amends for his low
tendencies of life in the eyes of his thoughtless
mates, but though he was by nature somewhat of
a leader still his personal popularity was low, and
it was only his physical prowess that gave him any
standing.</p>

<p>Seated upon one end of his study table was Hawley,
his face beaming with good nature and smiling
broadly as he faced the assembly in the room. In
one corner Peter John was standing, his back against
the wall and in his hands was one of the heavy
wooden chairs which he was grasping by the rounds.
Even in the somewhat dim light Will could see that
the great splotches of red on Peter John's face appeared
to be larger and of a more fiery tint than
<a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a>usual, and his coarse red hair fairly stood on end.
There was an expression of mingled terror and wild,
almost ungovernable, rage on his face, and Will
knew what that portended at that time. A brief
silence had followed Will's entrance, and Mott had
turned to some of his comrades and a meaning
smile appeared for a moment on his face as he perceived
who the new-comer was. In a moment, however,
the tense stillness of the room returned, and
Mott, turning to Peter John, said:</p>

<p>"Now, then, freshman, are you ready?"</p>

<p>"I'll brain the first man that comes near me!
Don't you lay a finger on me or I'll break your head!
This is my room and I'll have you understand that
you can't play any of your dirty tricks on me!"</p>

<p>Peter John's voice rose almost to a shriek, and
lifting the chair he gazed menacingly at Mott, almost
as if he was minded to rush upon him. Hawley
laughed as his room-mate spoke, but Will's face
became pale and he could almost hear the beating
of his own heart, so intensely excited was he. He
understood Peter John's disposition better than any
of those who were in the room, and his fear of
what might follow was great.</p>

<p>"We'll give you one more chance," said Mott
slowly.</p>

<p>"I don't want any more chances. I want you to
get out of this room! I didn't ask you to come!
You've no right here!" shouted Peter John.</p>

<p>"You didn't have to ask us," retorted Mott. "We
came because you need us and for the good of
the college. Come, freshman, do what I tell you."</p>

<p>"Don't you come near&mdash;" began Peter John, but
<a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a>the sentence was not completed. At some unseen
signal a half-dozen sprang upon him. Before he
could bring down the chair which he still was holding
above his head he was suddenly seized by his
adversaries, the chair was wrenched from his hands,
he was thrown heavily to the floor, and in a moment
his hands and feet were fast bound with cords, and
he was a helpless prisoner. Still he did not cease
his struggling, but as he twisted and writhed he
only drew the cords more tightly and made his own
helplessness more apparent.</p>

<p>"I know who you are!" he shrieked. "I'll report
you, every one! I'll give the whole list of your
names to the president! I'll have you arrested! I'll
put you in jail! You're a lot of thieves and low-down
scoundrels! I'll have you put where you won't
abuse anybody any more!" Peter John's voice rose
with every fresh threat until at last it almost broke
in a sob. He was almost beside himself, and Will
Phelps, though he shared in the anger of his classmate,
was rejoiced that he was helpless and could
not do what his desperation prompted.</p>

<p>"Tie your handkerchief over his mouth, Hines,"
said Mott to one of his companions. "We must
hush the infant's wailings or he'll have the whole
of Winthrop up here. He seems to have some language
besides that of the ordinary 'infant crying in
the night'."</p>

<p>At Mott's direction Hines and two of his classmates
at once securely bound a handkerchief about
Peter John's face, a task that was not accomplished
without a desperate struggle.</p>

<p>"Now then, since he seems to be quieted," said<a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a>
Mott at last, when his bidding had been done, "we'll
turn to the other part of the program. Here,
you freshman," he added, turning to Will Phelps
as he spoke, "step up here and take your seat beside
your classmate."</p>

<p>For an instant Will hesitated. The sight of Peter
John roused every instinct of combativeness which
he possessed, and that was by no means small, but
a laugh from Hawley restored a measure of self-possession,
and quietly and without a word he seated
himself on the table by the side of his friend.</p>

<p>"Good! That's the way to do it! Now then,
Hawley," said Mott, "you've got to get rid of that
eternal grin of yours. Wipe that smile off your
face and throw it out of the window."</p>

<p>Hawley laughed aloud as he said, "I've been trying
to get rid of it for nineteen years, but I haven't
succeeded yet. If you fellows will show me how to
do it I'll be yours truly now and for evermore."</p>

<p>Some of the sophomores laughed, but Mott glared
angrily at them as he said, "Quit that!" Then turning
again to Hawley he said, "Oh, we'll help you all
right enough. Just do as I tell you!"</p>

<p>"How shall I do it?"</p>

<p>"Take your handkerchief and wipe that smile off
your face and throw it out of the window as I tell
you."</p>

<p>Hawley drew a huge handkerchief from his pocket
with which he vigorously rubbed his face, and then
going soberly to the window pretended to throw
something out; but when he returned to his seat
his laughter became uncontrollable and he broke
<a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a>forth into a loud guffaw, in which some of the assembly
joined.</p>

<p>At Mott's rebuke the laughter ceased, and then
he said again to Hawley, "That won't do, freshman.
You're not rid of it yet. Try it again!"</p>

<p>Six times the huge and good-natured freshman
was compelled to repeat his senseless and silly
performance, and then Mott declared that he was
satisfied.</p>

<p>"Don't have a relapse," he said warningly, and
then, turning to Will Phelps, he said, "Now I want
my nice little boy, mamma's pet and papa's joy, to
show what a good little boy he really is. He isn't
going to do any of the naughty things that some
of the wicked little college boys do. He is strong,
he is, and he promised mamma he wouldn't, and he
won't. Let's give him a song, fellows," he added,
turning to his classmates, and at once the boys
began to sing:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"We're coming, we're coming, our brave little band,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the right side of temperance we always do stand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We don't use tobacco, for this we do think,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That those who do use it most always do drink."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Some of the singers had very musical voices and
the simple little ditty sounded very clear and strong
as they all joined in it. Will Phelps, however, was
thinking of what it was that would be required of
him. Then flashed into his mind the last conversation
he had had with his mother and in which he had
given her a promise not unlike that at which Mott
had hinted. And he intended to keep it too, he assured
himself. Come what might, he would not
<a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a>break it. He even smiled slightly as he thought of
what his mother's feelings would be if she could
look into Peter John's room and see what was then
going on there.</p>

<p>As the song ceased abruptly Will said, "What is it
you want me to do, Mott?"</p>

<p>"Well, now, freshman, that's cool. You can't
help being a freshman, but it's not well even for a
freshman to be too fresh. Ever hear the like of
that, fellows?" he inquired of his classmates.</p>

<p>"Never did. Never did," responded several, shaking
their heads soberly.</p>

<p>"Just think of it," began Mott again. "Here's a
freshman who is so anxious to get into our good
graces that he's not only willing to do what we tell
him but he even comes and asks us what it is we
want him to do. That beats anything old Winthrop
has ever seen yet."</p>

<p>Will's face flushed, but he was silent, though Hawley
began to laugh again. "Now, then, freshman,"
said Mott, pointing his finger at Will, "we want you
to get down on the floor and wrestle with temptation."</p>

<p>"There's nothing here that tempts me very much,"
replied Will coolly, and Hawley promptly laughed
aloud.</p>

<p>"You do as I tell you! Get down on the floor
and wrestle with temptation," demanded Mott
sharply.</p>

<p>"I don't mind doing it if it will please you any,"
responded Will as he slipped from his seat on the
table to the floor.<a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a>"That's the way. Now then, papa's joy and mamma's
pet, show us how it is that you do the trick."</p>

<p>Stretched upon the floor, Will Phelps went
through his struggle with an imaginary foe. He
twisted and writhed and struggled, shrieks of laughter
greeting his efforts from the assembled sophomores,
and even Hawley joined in, so ridiculous was
the appearance which Will presented.</p>

<p>"That's very good, very good indeed!" remarked
Mott when several minutes had elapsed. "You'd
better get up now and take a seat beside your
friend."</p>

<p>Will quickly did as he was bidden, laughing
slightly as he glanced at Hawley, whose imperturbable
good nature was not in anywise ruffled.</p>

<p>"Hawley, you're a great football player, I understand,"
said Mott.</p>

<p>"I'm a big player, can't say that I'm great. Some
fellows might think so, but it depends on whether
they've seen much or know much, I fancy."</p>

<p>"That's right. You're as modest as Mary's little
lamb. I hear you're a great sprinter," he added,
turning abruptly to Will Phelps.</p>

<p>"Oh, I can run a little. If you'll give me the
chance now I'll show you how I can leave the sophs
behind," said Will with a laugh, for he was now
feeling somewhat the effects of Hawley's manner
of meeting his tormentors, and as he glanced down
at Peter John it required no deep insight to perceive
which was the better way.</p>

<p>The boys in the room laughed good-naturedly and
one of them said, "That's enough, Mott. They don't
need any more."<a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a>"Hold on, I'm not done yet," replied Mott. "Tell
me what's the name of the little school from which
you came," he demanded of Will.</p>

<p>"The Sterling High School."</p>

<p>"And you ran there?"</p>

<p>"A little."</p>

<p>"Get any medals?"</p>

<p>"A few."</p>

<p>"Nice ones! Got any here?"</p>

<p>On his fob Will wore the gold medal he had won
the preceding June, but he laughed and made no
reply to Mott's question, fearful of incurring further
ridicule if he should display the trophy.</p>

<p>"Did you run against the track team of the Meadowbrook
Academy?" inquired Mott.</p>

<p>"No. Is that where you fitted?" replied Will
simply. Hawley broke into another loud laugh and
Mott's face flushed. Will perceived that he had
made a mistake and his better plan would be to
say as little as possible, whatever the provocation
might be or the opening his adversary might give
him.</p>

<p>"Did you beat the fast sprinter from the Toad
Hollow Institute?" demanded Mott.</p>

<p>"Can't say that I did. I never heard of the school
till now."</p>

<p>"Ever run against anybody from the Honeyville
Classical Seminary?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Or from the Smartville Four Corners team?"</p>

<p>"We didn't have anything to do with those
schools. We weren't in their class."</p>

<p>"Oh, let up, Mott. We've done enough. Let 'em
<a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a>go now," suggested one of the sophomores.</p>

<p>"Not yet," responded Mott. "We must have these
freshmen give us an exhibition of what they can
do. You fellows take off your collars," he said,
turning again to Will and his classmate.</p>

<p>For an instant Will Phelps hesitated and there
was a sudden tightening of the muscles in his arms,
but Hawley, good-natured and imperturbable as
ever, at once removed his collar and Will quietly
followed his example.</p>

<p>"That's good," said Mott encouragingly. "Now
take out your collar buttons."</p>

<p>Both freshmen obeyed, wondering what was to
be required of them. Their curiosity was speedily
relieved when Mott said, "We'll have a collar-button
race. You two athletes put these buttons on the
floor and push them across to the other side of the
room with your noses. The one that wins will make
the track team here I haven't a doubt."</p>

<p>Hawley again laughed loudly as he and Will took
the places assigned them. For a moment their faces
were near together and Hawley whispered a few
words in Will's ear. His companion's eyes flashed
in response, but he did not reply, and in a moment,
at Mott's word, the race was begun.</p>



<hr /><p><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a></p>
<h3><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h3>

<h4>A RACE IN THE DARKNESS</h4>


<p>Slowly and steadily the two freshmen began to
push the collar buttons across the floor. The floor
itself was uncarpeted and not particularly clean,
and the position and actions of the two boys certainly
did not add to their dignity; but there was
not a trace of a smile to be seen on the face of
either as they complied with the demands which
had been made. The sophomores in the room were
also serious, that is, all were save one, and, as he
laughed aloud at the ridiculous aspect of their victims,
Mott said savagely, "Put him out! He's no
business here? Get out of this room!"</p>

<p>The offending sophomore, despite his protests and
his promise to "be good," was thrust out from the
room, and the race was then resumed. Whenever
either of the contestants lagged or one seemed to be
gaining slightly upon the other he was sharply
bidden to make good his loss, and when the two
freshmen had come near the side of the room which
they were seeking to gain the collar buttons were
close together and each freshman could see the expression
on his companion's face. Perhaps it was
well for them both that the members of the rival
class could not see the quiet glance which Hawley
gave Will nor its equally keen response, but the look
was understood by both freshmen and they were
aware that the critical time in the contest was approaching.</p>

<p>They were by this time within two feet of the
<a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a>door which opened into the hall. The sophomores
who had been standing in front of it now moved
back to give the contestants room, and as Hawley
perceived that the way was clear, after looking up
for a moment and glancing keenly at his classmate,
he suddenly leaped to his feet and Will instantly
followed his example. Before the astonished sophomores
were fully aware of what was occurring
both had darted through the doorway after Hawley
had with almost incredible quickness flung open the
door. Instantly it was closed, and Hawley, seizing
the iron handle of the catch and putting forth all
his strength, braced his feet against the wall and
prepared to hold the inmates prisoners in the room.</p>

<p>"Get Andrews and Briggs!" whispered Hawley,
and Will quickly darted across the hallway to the
room of his two classmates. A word was sufficient
to inform them of what was occurring, and in an
incredibly brief time all three were standing beside
Hawley.</p>

<p>The giant freshman was holding the door, which
opened inward, easily, though the sophomores in the
room were striving desperately on their side. But
Hawley had the strong handle and only the tiny
latch could be seized from within. Numbers counted
for nothing in this struggle, as only one could
pull at a time.</p>

<p>The silence in the building was unbroken, though
the first thought of the bold freshmen had been that
their sophs would throw open the window and summon
their classmates to their aid. Whether it was
due to their excitement or to the fact that they did
not wish to have their predicament known, Will<a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a>
Phelps never learned, but no outcry was made,
though the steady pull upon the door continued.</p>

<p>"I've got 'em!" whispered Hawley gleefully. "If
the latch doesn't give way they won't see outdoors
again till I give 'em leave. Run, Will!" he added
hastily. "Get twenty of our fellows here as soon as
you can and we'll fix 'em yet. I can hold on here
forever!"</p>

<p>Leaving his classmates at the doorway, Will
Phelps ran swiftly down the stairs and sped across
the campus to his own room. He found his room-mate
seated at his desk, evidently hard at work.
Foster glanced up reprovingly as Will burst into the
room and said, "I thought, Will, you were&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped abruptly as he perceived how excited
his classmate was, but before he could make any
inquiries Will broke in: "We've got a lot of sophs
shut up in Peter John's room! Get some of the fellows
and make for the room! Hawley's holding 'em
in! Tell Jones and Camp to come and then tell
them to get some more and every one to bring two
or three with him. Get some more yourself and
I'll do the same."</p>

<p>Before his astonished room-mate could make any
further inquiries, Will darted out of the room and
ran down the stairway covering three steps at a leap.
But Foster understood what it was that was demanded
of him, and, without hesitating an instant,
seized his cap and swiftly followed.</p>

<p>The scheme worked marvelously well, and within
five minutes a band of twenty-five freshmen had
assembled in the hall in front of Peter John's and
Hawley's room in Leland. Hawley was still hold<a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a>ing
the door and no outcry from within the room
had been heard.</p>

<p>"How many sophs room in this entry?" said Will
quickly.</p>

<p>"Four," replied Hawley. "Two in the front corner
room on the second floor and two in the back
corner."</p>

<p>"Can you hold on till we can fix them?"</p>

<p>"I can hold on forever. But you'd better be quick
about it."</p>

<p>At Will's word four of his classmates followed him
to the floor below and two were speedily assigned to
hold one door while two more held the other. They
were to be quiet, and, if no outbreak was made, then
they were not to make their presence known, but
under no circumstances were the sophomores to be
permitted to come out from their rooms.</p>

<p>As soon as this arrangement had been perfected
Will ran swiftly back to join Hawley and his classmates
on the floor above. Hawley was still standing
at his post of duty, but as Will approached he
laughed silently and whispered:</p>

<p>"What'll we do now, fellows?"</p>

<p>Several whispered suggestions were made, but at
last it was agreed that the assembled freshmen
should step back on either side and that Hawley
should permit the door to be partly opened. It was
confidently believed that the sophomores would rush
out, and, if they did, a half-dozen were to be permitted
to come forth and these were to be seized as
silently as possible and bound by the freshmen as
their own unfortunate classmate, Peter John
Schenck, had already been treated. When a few had
<a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a>emerged and been seized then Hawley was to strive
to close the door again and hold the others within,
and, with the force thus divided, no strong resistance
could be made and the treatment which they were to
receive could be determined upon.</p>

<p>As soon as this decision had been made Hawley
withdrew from the door, but there was no pressure
upon it from within, and for a moment the assembled
freshmen stared blankly at one another as if
they feared that their game had escaped them and
that they themselves were the ones to appear in the
unenviable light. Will Phelps advanced as if he was
about to open the door, but a silent gesture from
Hawley caused him to abandon the project. As he
stepped back the latch clicked and the door was suddenly
opened. Evidently the inmates were surprised
that the door was free, and three or four cautiously
stepped forth to peer into the dimly lighted
hall. Before they were fully aware of the true condition
of affairs they were seized by the waiting
freshmen. There were sounds of a momentary
struggle, but when those who were within the room
attempted to come forth the door was quickly closed
in their faces and they were prisoners again. The
four who had been seized were quickly bound, and
then the assembly turned once more to the door itself.</p>

<p>"We'll go in," said Hawley, "and you musn't let a
soph get past you. We must hold every one in there.
Now then!" he added, as he pushed gently against
the door.</p>

<p>But the door failed to yield to the pressure. For
a moment the astounded freshmen knew not what to
<a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a>make of the unexpected resistance, and then as a
slight sound from within the room could be heard,
Hawley grimly braced himself against the door and
whispering to his classmates began to exert all his
strength in his endeavor to open it.</p>

<p>For a brief time it resisted all their efforts, and
then with a resounding crash it suddenly yielded.
But it seemed to the startled freshmen as if the very
walls themselves were giving way. There were the
sound of falling pieces of furniture and in the midst
of the confusion several of the sophomores suddenly
darted from the room, and before their enemies could
recover from their surprise had gained the head of
the stairway and were fleeing from the building.</p>

<p>"Take after 'em! Don't let 'em get away!" called
Hawley. "Hold on, it's all right," he quickly added
as he perceived Mott in the room. "We don't care
for anybody else for we've got the ringleader right
here. Let 'em go! Let 'em all go! We don't want
anybody else."</p>

<p>There was a momentary hesitation on the part of
the sophomores as if they were minded to stand by
their classmate, but as they peered about them it
seemed almost as if the entire freshman class were
present, and instantly discretion became the better
part of valor, and they fled in a body from the room
and also from the building.</p>

<p>Several of the freshmen had seized Mott by this
time, and his desperate attempts to free himself were
unavailing. Peter John had been quickly freed by
Will Phelps, and then Will said hastily to Hawley:</p>

<p>"We've stirred up the hornets' nest enough,
<a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a>haven't we? The sophs will be back here with all
their class. Shall we let him go?"</p>

<p>"Let him go?" laughed Hawley, whose enjoyment
seemed to be increasing with every passing moment.
"Well, I rather think not."</p>

<p>"What shall we do? They'll be back here in a
minute."</p>

<p>"Send everybody to his room. We'll look after
this fellow ourselves."</p>

<p>Will Phelps turned to his classmates and said:
"Get away from this fellows. The sophs will be
here in a minute and we may all be hauled up before
the faculty. We'll look after Mott."</p>

<p>Instantly the freshmen ran from Leland Hall, leaving
Will Phelps and Foster Bennett, and Peter John
and his room-mate to look after the captive sophomore.</p>

<p>"What'll we do with him?" inquired Will hastily.</p>

<p>"Take him over to your room."</p>

<p>"That'll be the first place they'll come to when they
don't find him here. Still, I'm perfectly willing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Take him out in the grove," suggested Foster
quickly. "If we can get away from here without
being seen we'll be all right there."</p>

<p>"That's the thing," assented Hawley. "Foster,
you run ahead and see if the coast is all clear, for we
may have to carry this fellow, and we might attract
some attention if we should happen to be seen on the
street."</p>

<p>"No, you won't. I'll go along all right," spoke up
Mott. "It's your turn now, but it'll be mine again,
you know, and I'll see that you freshmen pay up all
your scores with good interest!"<a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a>"Don't you threaten us!" said Peter John angrily,
speaking now for the first time.</p>

<p>"I'm not threatening you, freshman, I'm just telling
you what you'll have to go through, that's all.
You can do with me what you please, but whatever
you do you musn't forget that it'll be paid back five
times over."</p>

<p>"Don't stop here any longer. Come ahead, fellows,"
said Hawley quickly.</p>

<p>The party with Mott in their midst swiftly passed
down the stairway and turned into the street that
led toward "the grove," a clump of huge pine trees
that had stood for many years on the borders of the
rear campus of the college. The freshmen glanced
anxiously about them, but apparently their presence
was not noted by the few who were to be seen on the
street, and they quickly increased the pace at which
they were moving.</p>

<p>As they turned into the campus, Mott suddenly
broke away from his captors who had been somewhat
deceived by the apparent willingness with
which he had followed them, and began to run swiftly
back toward the college buildings. The sophomore
was known as one of the fleetest footed men
in college, and already Will Phelps had had him
pointed out as one of the few who had "made" the
track team in his freshman year. He had looked
up to him with the respect that only a freshman
can know for the prominent men in college life, and
now was his opportunity to test his own ability
against that of the fleeing member of the sophomore
class.<a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a>Quickly he darted in pursuit, feeling rather than
perceiving that his own classmates were speedily
left far behind him. He was exerting himself to the
utmost and ran as though the prize he was seeking
was the greatest of coveted honors. As he sped over
the grass his respect for his rival increased greatly,
for whatever Mott's defects might be, there certainly
was in him no lack of ability to run. The distance
between the runners was steadily maintained, and
indeed, it seemed to Will as if it was being increased.
On and on he ran, and the college buildings were
now near-by, and if the fleeing sophomore should
once gain an entrance in one of them then Will knew
all further pursuit would be useless.</p>

<p>Suddenly the form of Mott disappeared in the dim
light and Will Phelps stopped abruptly and peered
keenly before him. But when his classmates joined
him and all four cautiously advanced, several minutes
elapsed before a solution for the mystery was
found.</p>

<h4>SPLINTER'S QUESTIONS</h4>


<p>Directly before them the boys could see a long
ditch or trench which had been dug the entire length
of the back campus and of whose existence they had
not been aware. Doubtless Mott had known of it,
however, and in his flight had made for it with all
the speed he could command, either hoping to lead
his pursuers into difficulty or trusting that it in some
way would provide a means of escape for himself.</p>

<p>Whatever his plan may have been it succeeded admirably,
for when the four freshmen stood together
on the border of the trench not a sign of the presence
of Mott could be discovered. In which direction he
had fled they were also ignorant. It was evident
however that he was gone and after a careful search
had confirmed the conviction in their minds that the
sophomore had escaped, Will Phelps said:</p>

<p>"We'll have to give it up, fellows. He's gone."</p>

<p>"We can go up to his room and get him," suggested
Peter John, who was becoming exceedingly bold under
the confidence which the presence of his friends
gave him.</p>

<p>"We can, but we won't," said Hawley bluntly.</p>

<p>"Why not?" demanded Schenck.</p>

<p>"It's one thing to defend yourself, but it's another
to fly straight into the arms of the sophs. I don't
wonder that some of the freshmen get into trouble,
they're so fresh. If the sophs didn't take it out of
them I think our own class itself would."</p>

<p>"That's so," responded Peter John cordially, "I've
thought of it myself lots of times. Now there's<a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a>
Merrivale&mdash;he rooms next to me, you know&mdash;he
ought to be shown that he's too fresh."</p>

<p>"What's he done?" inquired Foster.</p>

<p>"Why he came into my room last week and borrowed
fifty cents, and he hasn't paid it back yet,
either!"</p>

<p>"Oh, well, just remember what Mott said, Peter
John."</p>

<p>"What did he say?"</p>

<p>"He said every freshman would be paid back with
interest."</p>

<p>"I don't want any interest," declared Peter John
in all seriousness. "I'll be satisfied if I'm paid back
without that."</p>

<p>"You'll get it, though," laughed Will; and as his
two companions also joined in his laugh Peter John
said no more, except that he "couldn't see anything
very funny in <i>that</i>."</p>

<p>The boys, however, did not longer delay where
they were but quietly returned to their rooms, nor
were they again disturbed that night. Indeed, for
several days the quiet of the college life was not
ruffled and both Will Phelps and his room-mate
began to hope that their troubles were at an end.
Mott, whom they saw on the following morning
when they were departing from chapel, laughed
good-naturedly as he greeted them and indeed his
friendship for them seemed to be increased by the
recent experiences through which he had passed.
Several times he came to the room of Will and Foster
and remained until his welcome was decidedly
that was displeasing to both the boys, though there
threadbare. There was something in his bearing
<a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a>was a certain indefinable something about him that
was not altogether unpleasant. His language, his
bearing, and his general appearance all betokened
a certain coarseness of fibre that somehow grated
upon the feelings of Will and his room-mate, though
they could not have explained even to themselves
just what it was. He was such a marked man in college,
however, and was looked up to by so many
that there was a certain pleasure in his personal
attention and both Will and Foster felt in a measure
the flattery of his evident favor.</p>

<p>The college work had now begun to settle into its
regular grooves and when another week had elapsed,
Will and Foster began to feel that the spirit of their
surroundings had to an extent been received by them
and that they were indeed a part of the life. There
were moments now that came to Will, when do what
he might he could not banish from his mind the
thought of the home in Sterling of which practically
he was no longer a part. The vision of his father
seated in his easy-chair in the library of an evening,
before the fire that glowed upon the hearth,
his paper in his hands and the very manner in which
he occasionally glanced up and read to his mother
something he had noticed seemed to be one that Will
could not shake off. The pictures on the walls, the
very rugs on the floor, and the chairs in the room
could all be distinctly seen, and somehow the sight
never failed to bring a certain depression with it.
Will Phelps would indignantly have denied that he
was homesick, but as the days came and went his
manner became somewhat subdued and when he
rose from his bed in the early morning and peered
<a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a>forth from his bedroom window at the towering hills
that were all aglow with the glory of the rising sun,
somehow their very beauty and grandeur seemed to
deepen his feeling that he was "a good way off," as
he expressed it, though just what it was that was
so far away he could only have vaguely expressed
or defined. Doubtless his room-mate could have
explained to him that it was the little city of Sterling
that now seemed to be so remote, for he too
was suffering slightly from the same malady that
troubled his friend.</p>

<p>Why is it that most boys are so afraid to acknowledge
that they are ever homesick? Is it the fear
that they may appear too dependent and less manly
if they confess their longing for home? Certainly
no boy who comes from a good home detracts from
his own strength of character by acknowledging that
he misses the home from which he has gone. Indeed,
is it not a reflection upon the boy and the home alike,
if he declares when he goes from his father's house
that he misses nothing? To yield to the feeling of
homesickness, to permit it to overmaster one and
prevent him from performing his tasks in the place
wherein he finds himself may be a confession of
weakness, but to suffer nothing from it is to declare
a weakness or defect greater still. And Will Phelps,
though he was silent as to his own feelings, was
suffering keenly in the early days of his life in
Winthrop.</p>

<p>A week had elapsed since the events recorded in
the preceding chapter and Will and Foster were
studying busily in their rooms one evening, striving
to hold their wearied minds to their work, for there
<a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a>had been an unexpected written test that day in
their Greek and both were somewhat anxious as to
the results of their efforts.</p>

<p>Suddenly the door opened and in walked Peter
John, who had already acquired the collegiate habit
of never inquiring if his presence was welcome in
the room into which he came. His face was beaming
and it was at once evident to both Will and Foster
that their classmate had something of importance
to declare.</p>

<p>"How'd you get along in the test to-day, fellows?"
was Peter John's first question.</p>

<p>"Not very well," replied Will, motioning for his
visitor to be seated.</p>

<p>"I just killed it."</p>

<p>Will and Foster laughed as they heard Peter John
already indulging in college slang. It seemed so out
of keeping with his general bearing and appearance.
The gap between his trousers and his shoes had
never been so apparent, his splotches so vivid, nor
his hair so belligerent as now.</p>

<p>"There's that question, 'Who were the mercenaries
of the Greeks, and what was a mercenary?' I got
that right, I know I did."</p>

<p>"How did you answer it?" inquired Foster.</p>

<p>"Why, I said 'a mercenary was a man that sold
himself to some one,' and I showed what I meant by
illustrating it."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"I said the professors were the mercenaries of the
college."</p>

<p>"You did?" exclaimed Will, sitting instantly erect.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; I did. What's the matter?" he added,
<a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a>as both boys began to laugh loudly. "Isn't it true?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's too good to be true. Tell us some more,
Peter John."</p>

<p>"I can't see what you fellows are laughing at,"
said Peter John soberly. "That answered the question
all right. I'll get an 'A' on that paper. Then
there was that question, 'What was the Greek law
and conception of vengeance?' That bothered me a
bit at first, but I got it, I'm sure."</p>

<p>"What did you say?" inquired Will.</p>

<p>"Why, that's as plain as the nose on your face,"
responded Peter John glibly. "I said that vengeance
was a low-down, mean, spiteful attempt to pay
back. 'Vengeance is mine and I will repay,' saith
the Lord."</p>

<p>"Oh, you'll get more than 'A' on that," said Will
in the extremity of his delight, as he was compelled
to go to the window and gaze out into the night.
"You'll get at least A square."</p>

<p>"No, I won't. They don't give that. 'A' is the
highest mark they give. But I think I got everything
right. How did you answer that question
about what Christian tenet the Greeks believed in?"
he added, glancing at the copy of the questions which
he held in his hands.</p>

<p>"How did <i>you</i> answer it, Peter John?" inquired
Foster quickly.</p>

<p>"I answered it that they believed in the immorality
of the soul."</p>

<p>"In the <i>what?</i>" demanded Foster soberly.</p>

<p>"In the immorality of the soul."</p>

<p>"You meant immortality of the soul, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Y-e-s, I suppose I did," assented Peter John
<a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a>somewhat ruefully. "But old Splinter will understand,"
he added quickly. "Splinter will know I
just left out a 't', and he won't count that against
me."</p>

<p>"No, a little thing like a 't' doesn't count for
much, not any more than a decimal point. It doesn't
make any difference whether a decimal point is
placed before or after a figure, you know. It's only
a little thing anyway."</p>

<p>"Yes," assented Peter John, failing to perceive
what Foster was saying. "Then there was one other
question that was dead easy," he added.</p>

<p>"Which one was that?"</p>

<p>"The one about the animals."</p>

<p>"Let me see, what was that question?" said Foster
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Why, don't you remember? It was 'Name six
animals that were common among the Greeks'."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; I recall it now; but I don't think I had
it right. I could think of but four."</p>

<p>"Pooh! Easiest question of the whole lot."</p>

<p>"What was the answer?"</p>

<p>"Easy! Dead easy! I just said, 'Six dogs'."</p>

<p>The laughter that rang out in the room might
have been heard across the campus; but Peter John
was only slightly ruffled, and said:</p>

<p>"Oh, well, you fellows may laugh if you want to,
but you'll find out when you see my marks."</p>

<p>"They'll put you in Splinter's place as soon as you
graduate," suggested Foster when at last he regained
control of himself.</p>

<p>"I wish they would," responded Will heartily.</p>

<p>"Splinter" was the term by which the Winthrop
<a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a>boys were accustomed to speak of Professor Hanson,
who was in charge of their Greek work. The title
did not appear in the college catalog, it was true;
but it was the only one by which he was known
among the irreverent students. He was an elderly
man, whose sensitive nature had suffered for many
years from the inadequate preparation of successive
classes, until at last not only were his teeth on edge,
but his entire disposition as well. He had become
somewhat soured and sarcastic in his dealings with
the students, and was more unpopular than any
other professor in the college. His scholarship was
accurate. His ability to impart his knowledge to
such students as were eager to learn was also unquestioned,
but for the indifferent and lazy, or for
the dull or poorly prepared, his words were like
drops of vitriol.</p>

<p>His popular title of Splinter had been bestowed
upon him because of certain physical characteristics
however. He was a very tall man and exceedingly
thin, and the very beard which he wore imparted
by its sharp point an additionally suggestive
emphasis to his slight and slender frame. No one
knew how the title originated or how it came to be
bestowed upon the professor; but its appropriateness
had at once fastened the term and every entering
class received it as a heritage from those which
had preceded it.</p>

<p>Will Phelps already had acquired a keen dislike
for the man, and he had laughed heartily when Mott
one night had declared that the student body had
been compelled to give Professor Hanson the new
name he had received. "You see," Mott had said,<a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a>
"the faculty and the trustees decide what titles a
man can wear <i>after</i> his name; so it's only fair that
the students should decide what titles he shall wear
<i>before</i> his name. Now this man's name used to be
simply John Hanson. Then some college or other
said it should be John Hanson, PH.D. Well, the
students here have only gone a step further and
they've not taken anything away from the old fellow.
They've added to him, that's what they have; and
now it's Prof. Splinter John Hanson, PH.D. He
ought to be grateful, but it's a cold world and I
sometimes fear he doesn't appreciate what was
done for him. In fact such bestowments are rarely
received as they should be."</p>

<p>The suggestion Will's room-mate had made that
Peter John soon might take Splinter's place had
recalled his own difficulties with the man, but soon
even the thoughts of the unpopular professor of
Greek were forgotten in the new interest that was
aroused by the entrance into the room of three young
men who were at once recognized as members of the
junior class.</p>

<h4>THE PARADE</h4>


<p>"You're just the fellows we're looking for," said
Allen, the leading spirit of the three young men
who entered the room.</p>

<p>"You haven't very far to look, then," replied Will
laughingly, for in his heart he felt honored by the
unexpected visit of the upper classmen.</p>

<p>"That's right, freshman. How are you getting
on?"</p>

<p>"They've kept us busy, to say the least."</p>

<p>"You mean the sophs?"</p>

<p>"Yes. That's the only class we have to think of,
isn't it?"</p>

<p>"No. Your own class is first."</p>

<p>"It's the best class in college," interrupted Peter
John quickly, and all who were in the room laughed
as the uncouth freshman's face flushed.</p>

<p>"That's the way to talk," responded Allen.</p>

<p>"But it is. I'm not joking," persisted Peter John
seriously.</p>

<p>"No doubt. No doubt. But what we've come for
is to tell you about the parade."</p>

<p>"Parade? What parade?" inquired Foster.</p>

<p>"Why, every fall there is a parade of the freshmen.
They have a band usually, at least most of the
classes have had one and as yours is the best class
that ever entered college, why you won't want to
fall behind the others I know."</p>

<p>"Who pays for the band?" demanded Peter John.</p>

<p>"You do, that is, your class does."<a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a></p>

<p>"I won't pay a cent," retorted Peter John.</p>

<p>"You don't have to," laughed Allen. "Some of
the others will make it up. I'm just telling you
what the custom is and only for your own good."</p>

<p>"Go on with your story," interrupted Will. "Let's
hear about the parade."</p>

<p>"It's to come off next Saturday afternoon, and we
juniors usually help out in the scheme, you see. We
try to arrange a part of it for you and help you out
in some of the details. The whole thing is 'horse
play,' just a sort of burlesque, and the more ridiculous
you can make it, the better."</p>

<p>"I'll not make a fool of myself for anybody,"
spoke up Peter John sharply.</p>

<p>"You don't have to. It won't be necessary," replied
Allen quietly, but in the laugh that followed,
Peter John took no part.</p>

<p>"What do you want us to do?" inquired Foster.</p>

<p>"Well, we suggest that this young man&mdash;I've forgotten
his name," said Allen, turning to Peter John
as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Schenck. Peter John Schenck&mdash;that's my name,
and I'm not ashamed of it either!" said that worthy
promptly. "But I don't propose to hire a band and
march around the streets making a fool of myself
for anybody."</p>

<p>"You don't have to," and again a laugh arose at
the junior's words. "I was only suggesting, that's
all. But if you want to know what I think, I'm
of the opinion that if you'd be one to help haul the
committee from the senior class around in their
chariot it would be a good thing for you. That's
<a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a>only a suggestion on my part, as I told you, and you
can do as you please about it."</p>

<p>"I don't please to do it," replied Peter John sulkily.</p>

<p>"What's the 'chariot' you spoke of, Allen?" inquired
Will.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's only an old hay wagon. It's been the
custom for some of the freshmen to haul the officers
of the senior class around in it. It doesn't amount
to much, but honestly I think it will be a good thing
for you to do it."</p>

<p>"All right, you can count on me," said Will quickly.</p>

<p>"I don't want to count on that from you. I've
something else for you and Bennett to do."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"I'll explain it to you." And Allen at once went
into the details of the scheme he proposed. Both
Will and Foster laughed as he laid it before them,
and willingly consented to do their part. Peter
John, however, said not a word, and when the visitors
prepared to depart, Allen said, "You're to
assemble at the gym, you know, and the parade will
be formed in front of it on the street. It'll march
up Main Street, down East End Avenue, around
through Walker Street, up West Street, across Drury
Lane and then back into Main Street and then on
down to the ball ground. There the parade will
break up and the freshmen and sophomores will
have their annual ball game. It'll be great fun if
you take it in the right spirit, and you'll have plenty
of spectators too."</p>

<p>"How's that?" said Foster.</p>

<p>"Why, the whole college, faculty and all, will
turn out to see it, and of course all the village peo<a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a>ple
will be on hand, and if it's a good day there'll
be a crowd here from out of town. The trains will
be crowded that day, and there'll be a good many
who'll come into Winthrop with their automobiles.
You'll never forget the day as long as you live."</p>

<p>"Great!" exclaimed Will. "I wish it was to-morrow.
Where shall we get these things we're to
wear?"</p>

<p>"You can find them in the stores, or maybe I'll
be able to help you out some. Come down to my
room to-morrow and I'll see what can be done.
Good night," Allen added, as he and his classmates
started down the stairway.</p>

<p>"Good night," responded Will and Foster, and
then closed the door.</p>

<p>"Of all the foolishness I ever heard that beats all,"
said Peter John when the freshmen were by themselves
once more. "They don't get me into it."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Peter John. Don't pull off that way,"
said Will cordially.</p>

<p>"Not much. I'm not so big a fool as they take
me to be."</p>

<p>"You'll be a bigger one if you keep out."</p>

<p>"Maybe I will, but I'm not going to go into any
such doings."</p>

<p>"Now look here, Peter John. You're a freshman,
but you can't help that and no one blames you for
it. I'm&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm no more a freshman than you are," retorted
Peter John warmly.</p>

<p>"Right you are. But you don't want to make a
bad matter worse. If you keep out you'll be a
marked man and everybody in college will hear
<a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a>about it. It'll be a great deal better for you to go
in quietly, and whatever you think about it, just
keep your thoughts to yourself, and don't call the
attention of the whole college to you by your foolishness.
It'll be simply a challenge for the sophs, if
you don't do it, and you'll be the one to suffer."</p>

<p>"You think so?"</p>

<p>"I know so."</p>

<p>"I guess the sophs found out what sort of a fellow
I was the other night. I'd have brained the first
one that laid hands on me."</p>

<p>"You didn't though, and you wouldn't. It's a
great deal better to do as Hawley did and just
laugh it off."</p>

<p>"Oh, I laughed all right, and I'd have given those
fellows something to laugh about too, if they hadn't
tied me up."</p>

<p>"Of course, but the trouble is they did tie you up,
and the next time it'll be worse than that. It isn't
worth while to kick too hard, Peter John. A fellow
has just got to take some things in life as he finds
them and not as he'd like to have them. It's the
only way, and the sooner he learns it the better."</p>

<p>"But my father told me never to let anybody impose
on me," said Peter John dubiously.</p>

<p>"Nobody is going to impose on you. You won't
be doing anything more than every fellow in the
class, and if you don't go in you'll be the one marked
exception. The sophs will take it as an invitation."</p>

<p>"You think so, do you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I do. Come along, Peter John, and
don't make any more fuss about it."<a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a>"Well, I'll think about it," replied the freshman
as he departed for his own room in Leland Hall.</p>

<p>Saturday dawned bright and clear and the interest
and excitement in the college over the parade rose
to its highest point. A band had been secured from
a neighboring city, and in the afternoon, when its
stirring strains were heard from the steps of the
gymnasium, all the freshmen were made aware that
the time for their assembly had arrived. There
were crowds of strangers to be seen about the streets
and the little town was all active with unwonted
bustle. Automobiles were arriving, the sophomores
were assembling at the various buildings, and their
jeers and cries could be heard as they greeted the
appearance of the members of the class below them
when they started for the gymnasium.</p>

<p>Will Phelps and Foster Bennett felt keenly the
prevailing excitement, and when they entered the
gymnasium building they found a large number of
their own classmates already assembled and keenly
alive to the demands that were soon to be made
upon them.</p>

<p>Under the experienced guidance of the committee
of juniors the freshmen were soon equipped for
their various parts and the procession was formed.
In advance moved the band and behind it was
a huge hay wagon in which in great dignity were
seated six of the seniors. The wagon itself was
drawn by sixteen freshmen, all of whom had a tight
grasp upon the ropes that had been fastened to the
wagon tongue. Directly behind the wagon came
Will Phelps and Foster Bennett and two of their
classmates, all dressed in the garb of firemen, with
<a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a>red jackets and helmet hats of paper. In their
hands was a huge rope at least two and a half
inches in diameter, which was attached to a tiny
tin fire engine not more than a foot in length. Behind
the firemen came Hawley, who was dressed
as an infant with a lace cap on his head and carefully
tied bows under his chin, while in his hands
he was carrying a bottle of milk. He was seated
in an improvised baby carriage, which was being
pushed by one of the smallest members of the freshman
class. "Sunny Jim," Charley Chaplin and Ben
Turpin were among the characters that could
be seen in the long lines of freshmen that, three
abreast, were arranged still farther back in the procession,
and at last, at the word of Allen, the junior
who was acting as the marshal of the day, the march
was begun. Frequently Will turned and glanced
behind him at the long, tortuous line, and its ridiculous
appearance caused him to laugh and say to
Foster:</p>

<p>"Did you ever see anything in your life like that?"</p>

<p>"I never did."</p>

<p>"Silence there in the ranks!" called Allen sharply,
for he chanced to be marching near the "fire engine."
Not a trace of a smile could be seen on his face, and
to all appearances he was engaged in what he considered
one of the most serious events of his life.</p>

<p>In the streets the people were lined up and their
laughter and good-natured applause could be heard
on every side. Small boys followed the line of march
or walked beside the long column, and their derisive
remarks were frequent and loud. The sophomores
also added their comments, but there was no open
<a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a>disturbance throughout the march. It was one of
the events of freshman year and as such was evidently
not to be entered upon lightly or unadvisedly,
like certain other important epochs in life.</p>

<p>At last the procession arrived at the athletic
field and there broke up for the baseball game with
the sophomores. The grand stand was already filled
with the people and students that had watched the
march, and, as soon as Will and Foster had donned
their baseball suits, for both had been selected to
play on the freshman nine, they appeared upon the
field, where already the other members of the team
were awaiting their coming.</p>

<p>"I didn't see Peter John, did you, Foster?" inquired
Will.</p>

<p>"No. It'll be all the worse for him, I fancy."</p>

<p>"No doubt about that. What are we going to
do with him, Foster?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"I don't like to see the chap suffer for his own
foolishness."</p>

<p>"Neither do I. But he'll have to learn for himself.
You can't tell him anything."</p>

<p>"You can <i>tell</i> him all right enough, but I'm afraid
that's all the good it does. You might as well try to
polish sponge."</p>

<p>The conversation ceased as the call for the game
to be begun was heard and both boys hastened to
take the positions in which they were to play. The
noise among the spectators increased as the signal
was given, but for three innings both nines played
earnestly and seriously. At the end of the third
inning, with the score standing five to four in favor
<a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a>of the sophomores, a radical change was made. The
batter was blindfolded and compelled to stand upon
an upturned barrel, which was substituted for the
home plate. The pitcher and catcher were each also
to stand upon a barrel and the pitcher was ordered
to throw the ball with his left hand. Naturally it
was impossible for the batter to hit the ball, since
he was blindfolded, and when three strikes had been
called he tore the bandage from his eyes and upon
his hands and knees was compelled to crawl toward
first base. The baseman stood with his back to the
field and naturally found it difficult to secure the
ball which had been thrown by the left hand of the
catcher. Shrieks of laughter arose from the spectators,
shouts and class cries were heard on every
side, tin horns mingled their noise with the blasts
of the band, and altogether Will Phelps thought
that the scene was unique in the experiences of his
young life.</p>

<h4>THE WALK WITH MOTT</h4>


<p>In the days that immediately followed the freshman
parade and the burlesque game of baseball with
the rival class, the work before Will Phelps and his
room-mate settled more deeply into its regular
grooves. The novelty of the new life was now gone
and to Will it almost seemed that ages had passed
since he had been a member of the household in
Sterling. His vision of the hilltops from his bedroom
window became longer and he could see in his
mind far behind the towering barriers of the hills
into the familiar street and well-remembered rooms
of his father's house. The foliage on the hillsides
now had assumed its gorgeous autumn dress and
wherever he looked the forests seemed to be clad
as if they were all on dress parade. The sight was
beautiful and one which in after years was ever
present with him; but in those early days of his
freshman year in Winthrop, it seemed somehow to
impress him as a great barrier between his home
and the place where he then was.</p>

<p>However, he never referred to his feeling to any
one, not even to Foster, and strove manfully to
bear it all. He was working well, but in his Greek
he was finding increasing difficulty. This he acknowledged
in part was due to his own neglect in
the earlier years of his preparatory course, but
boy-like he attributed most of his lack of success
in that department to "Splinter," for whom he came
to cherish a steadily increasing dislike. The man's
<a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a>personality was exceedingly irritating to the young
freshman and his dislike for the professor was becoming
intense&mdash;a marked contrast to his feeling
for his teacher in mathematics for whom he entertained
a regard that was but little short of adoration.
His knowledge evidently was so great, and
his inspiring personality in the classroom was so
enjoyable that Will soon found himself working in
that department as he never before had worked in
his brief life. Already, the boys were referring to
him as a "shark," and the praise of his classmates
was sweet. But in Greek&mdash;that was an altogether
different affair, he declared. Splinter was so cold-blooded,
so unsympathetic, and sarcastic, he appeared
to be so fond of "letting a fellow make a fool
of himself in recitation," as Will expressed it, that
he found but little pleasure in his work. And Will
had already suffered from the keen shafts of the
teacher's merciless ridicule. One day, when in fact
he had spent an additional hour in the preparation
of his lesson in Greek, though the results he had
achieved left him still troubled as he thought of
the recitation, he had been called upon to translate
and make comments upon a portion of the lesson of
the day. He could feel as well as see, or at least
he fancied that he saw, the drawing down of Splinter's
lips that presaged an outburst of sarcasm.
Will had been permitted to go through his task without
interruption and then the professor had said
dryly, "That will do, Mr. Phelps. That is what one
might term 'making Greek' of it. It certainly is
justice neither to the Greek nor to the English."
A partly suppressed titter had run through the class
<a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a>at the biting words, and with face flushed scarlet
Will Phelps had resumed his seat, feeling that in all
the world there could not be found another man so
thoroughly despicable as Splinter. And his feeling
of dislike had increased with the passing days. He
had come not only to detest the man, but the Greek
as well. If he could have followed his own desire
he would have abandoned the subject at once and
substituted something in its place, but Will understood
fully his father's desire for him to become
proficient in that department and how useless it
would be for him to write home for the desired permission.
In sheer desperation he began to devote
additional time to his study of Greek, until he felt
that he was almost neglecting certain other studies
in his course that in themselves were far more
enjoyable. But his progress under Splinter seemed
to be in no wise advanced, and soon Will was cherishing
a feeling that was something between a hopeless
rage and an ungovernable detestation.</p>

<p>One break had occurred, however, in that both he
and Foster had joined one of the Greek letter fraternities&mdash;the
Phi Alpha. Both freshmen were now
taking their meals at the fraternity house and in
the good fellowship and the presence of his fellow-members
he found a measure of relief from the
homesickness that was troubling him and his difficulties
with the detested professor of Greek. It
was also a source of some comfort to him to learn
that his own feeling for Splinter was one that was
commonly held by all the students who had been
under him; but though his misery may have loved
the company, his problem still remained his own
<a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a>and appeared to be as far from solution as ever.</p>

<p>Not long after Will and Foster had joined the
Phi Alpha fraternity, Peter John had dropped into
their room one evening and quickly discovered the
neat little badge or pin that each boy wore on his
vest directly over his heart.</p>

<p>"Hello!" exclaimed Peter John; "you've joined
the Phi Alpha, have you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Will quietly, striving then to
change the topic of conversation, for the subject
was one not to be cheapened by ordinary remarks.</p>

<p>"It's about the best in college, isn't it?" persisted
Peter John.</p>

<p>"That's not for us to say," laughed Will.</p>

<p>"I haven't joined any fraternity yet," said Peter
John. "My father told me I'd better wait and perhaps
he'd come up to Winthrop a little later and
then he'd tell me which one to join."</p>

<p>Will and Foster glanced at each other, but neither
spoke. In fact there was nothing to say.</p>

<p>"If you feel sure the Phi Alpha's the best, I might
write home to my father and perhaps he'd let me
join now," suggested Peter John. "He thinks that
whatever you two fellows do is about right."</p>

<p>As only about half the students in Winthrop were
members of the Greek letter fraternities, and as
those who were elected were chosen because of certain
elements in their characters or lives that made
them specially desirable as companions or comrades,
the election was naturally looked upon as
an especial honor and many of the entering class
had been eagerly awaiting the invitation for which
all longed. Peter John Schenck's unique personality
<a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a>and his sublime self-assurance had been qualities,
if no other defects had been apparent, that would
have debarred him, but he was so sublimely unconscious
of all this&mdash;"Not even knowing enough to
know that he didn't know, the worst form of ignorance
in all the world," Foster had half angrily declared&mdash;that
not for a moment did he dream that
his membership was something perhaps undesirable
of itself.</p>

<p>"I might write home and ask him," suggested
Peter John when neither of his classmates responded.
"I think I like the Phi Alpha pretty well myself."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't do it," said Foster. "How are you
making out with Splinter?" he added, striving to
change the subject.</p>

<p>"Oh, Splinter's all right."</p>

<p>"Glad you think so," said Will bitterly.</p>

<p>"Some of the fellows think he's hard, but he's all
right if you know how to handle him," declared
Peter John pompously. "I'll put down a good mark
for him."</p>

<p>"Good for you, Peter John!" laughed Foster.
"Wait till he puts down your mark."</p>

<p>"I'll get an 'A' in Greek."</p>

<p>"I hope you'll give me a part of it then," said
Will. "Did you ever see such a fellow?" he said
to Foster when their visitor had departed.</p>

<p>"I never did. I don't mind him myself, but for
his own sake I wish he could learn something. I
don't believe he'll ever do it though."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid he'll be taught some things that are
not in the course of study."<a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a>"Do him good," remarked Foster, as he turned
once more to his work.</p>

<p>The following day was Saturday, and in the afternoon
there were no recitations. Will had promised
Mott that he would go for a long walk with him,
and promptly after luncheon the sophomore appeared.
For some reason which Will could not
explain, Mott appeared to have taken a decided
fancy to him, and had paid him many special attentions.
There was little about him that was attractive
to Will, but somehow he found it difficult to
avoid him. He certainly was a well dressed handsome
young fellow, and was prominent in college
chiefly because of his success in athletics, for already
he had the reputation of being one of the swiftest
runners in college. But in the college vernacular he
was commonly referred to as a "sport," a term for
which Will instinctively had little liking, and less
for the young man himself. However, he had found
it difficult to avoid him, and somewhat reluctantly
he had consented to take the long walk to a distant
village with him on the day to which reference has
been made.</p>

<p>For a time after the two young men had departed
from Winthrop, and had made their way up the road
that led along the steep hillside, the exhilaration of
the bracing air and the superb view had made Will
keenly alive to the beauties of the surrounding
region. A soft halo covered the summits of the lofty
hills, and the quiet of the valley was almost as impressive
as the framework of the mountains. Mott
too had been exceedingly pleasant in all that he had
said, and Will was almost beginning to feel that he
<a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a>had misjudged his companion, and that his reputation
was worse than the fellow himself.</p>

<p>They had now left the hillside road and were once
more in the valley and not far from the village they
were seeking.</p>

<p>"I hear you're quite a fair sprinter," suggested
Mott, as they proceeded.</p>

<p>"I do a little," assented Will, laughing lightly as
he spoke.</p>

<p>"Where did you run?"</p>

<p>"On the high school team."</p>

<p>"What high school?"</p>

<p>"Sterling."</p>

<p>"Run against the other schools in the league?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Will, wondering how it was that
Mott happened to know of the existence of the
league.</p>

<p>"How did you come out?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I happened to win. There wasn't very much
to run against, you see."</p>

<p>"What time did you make?"</p>

<p>"Ten, two."</p>

<p>"Going to run here?"</p>

<p>"Going to try to."</p>

<p>"I find this taking long walks is good for me," said
Mott. "It keeps my muscles in trim and gives me
wind."</p>

<p>This, then, was the object which Mott had in view
in inviting him to take the walk, Will hastily concluded.
He wanted to find out all he could learn
about his ability as a runner, and in spite of himself
Will was flattered by the evident interest and attention.
They were now within the confines of the
<a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a>village, and excusing himself for a moment Mott left
Will, but when he returned it was evident from the
odor about him that the sophomore had been to some
speakeasy. Will had known of Mott's habits, and the
fact that he had left him and gone alone to secure
his drink argued that the fellow was not altogether
bad.</p>

<p>There was not a long delay in the village, and the
return by a different road from that by which they
had come was suggested by Mott, and Will had
acquiesced. They had not gone far, however, before
Mott discovered a farmer approaching with a team
and a heavy but empty farm wagon, and quickly
suggested that they should ride, and as Will at once
agreed, his companion hailed the passing man.</p>

<p>"Hi, grandpa! Will you give us a ride?" he
called.</p>

<p>Without a word the farmer, who was an old man,
halted his team and permitted the boys to clamber
up into the wagon.</p>

<p>"This is more like it," said Mott, forgetful of the
benefits of walking, as the horses started.</p>

<p>"It's not half bad," replied Will, as he glanced
at the old man who was driving. A straw hat covered
his gray head, and his untrimmed gray beard
as well as his somewhat rough clothing could not
entirely detract from the keen twinkle in his eyes.</p>

<p>"I fancy," said Mott, addressing the driver, "that
the beauties of this country have added much to
your longevity?"</p>

<p>"My which?" demanded the farmer sharply.</p>

<p>"Your longevity."</p>

<p>"I never had no such complaint's that. I've had
<a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a>the rheumatiz, but that's all that ever bothered
me any."</p>

<p>"You are to be congratulated," murmured Mott.</p>

<p>"Guess that's so. See that buryin' ground over
there?" inquired the driver, pointing as he spoke to
a quaint little cemetery by the roadside.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Mott. "Probably most of the people
died of longevity."</p>

<p>"It don't tell on th' gravestones. Jest got a new
gravedigger."</p>

<p>"How's that?"</p>

<p>"Third we've had inside o' a year. Had one fur
nigh onto forty year, but he up an' died."</p>

<p>"Longevity?" gravely inquired Mott.</p>

<p>"Like enough; though some folks thought 'twas
softenin' o' th' brain; but my 'pinion is he never had
any brains to get soft. Still he were a good digger,
but the man we got next was no good."</p>

<p>"What was the trouble with him? More longevity?"</p>

<p>"No; he buried everybody with their feet to the
west."</p>

<p>"Isn't that the proper thing?"</p>

<p>"No, 'tisn't!"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Any fool knows ye ought t' be buried with yer
feet t' the east."</p>

<p>"Why's that?"</p>

<p>"So't ye can hear Gabriel's trumpet better when
he blows, an' can rise up facin' him an' be all
ready t' go when he calls."</p>

<p>"I hadn't thought of that."<a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a>"Like 's not. Some folks don't. We've got another
digger now, an' he knows."</p>

<p>For a time conversation ceased, and the farmer
drove briskly along the country road. When an
hour had elapsed, Mott said, "I don't see that we're
getting anywhere near Winthrop."</p>

<p>"Winthrop? Is that where ye want t' go? Students
there, maybe?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, we've been goin' straight away from Winthrop
all the time. Ye didn't say nothin' 'bout it,
an' I didn't feel called upon t' explain, for I supposed
college students knew everything."</p>

<p>"How far is it to Winthrop?" inquired Will
blankly.</p>

<p>"'Beout ten mile," responded the farmer, his eyes
twinkling as he reined in his team.</p>

<h4>A VISITOR</h4>


<p>The boys both hastily leaped to the ground and
the old farmer quickly spoke to his team and started
on, leaving his recent passengers in such a frame of
mind that they even forgot to thank him for his
courtesy and kindness. As the wagon drove off, Will
fancied that he heard a sly chuckle from the driver
but he had disappeared around the bend in the road
before the young freshman recovered from his astonishment
sufficiently to speak of it.</p>

<p>"That old chap wasn't such a fool after all," said
Mott glumly.</p>

<p>"That's what he wasn't," responded Will beginning
to laugh.</p>

<p>"What are you laughing at?" demanded Mott
sharply.</p>

<p>"At ourselves."</p>

<p>"I don't see the joke."</p>

<p>"Might as well laugh as cry."</p>

<p>"You'll sing another song before you're back in
Winthrop to-night. Ten miles isn't any laughing
matter after we've tramped as far as we have
to-day."</p>

<p>"But it'll help us for our track meet," suggested
Will, laughing again.</p>

<p>"Bother the track meet!"</p>

<p>"It'll help our longevity then. I've always heard
that walking was the best exercise."</p>

<p>"The old fellow was foxy. He never said a word
<a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a>but just let us talk on. I'd give a dollar to hear his
account of it when he gets home."</p>

<p>"Cheap enough. But say, Mott, have we got to
tramp all the way back to Winthrop?"</p>

<p>"Looks that way."</p>

<p>"Can't we get a car here somewhere?"</p>

<p>"Hardly. We might try it at that farmhouse over
yonder," replied Mott pointing toward a low house
not far away as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Come ahead! Let's try it anyway," suggested
Will eagerly.</p>

<p>The boys at once hastened to the place, and after a
brief delay succeeded in summoning the young
farmer who lived there. They made their wishes
known, but in response the man said, "Can't do it
anyhow. My wife's sick and I'm goin' for the doctor
now."</p>

<p>"Where is he?" demanded Will eagerly.</p>

<p>"Over at the Junction."</p>

<p>Will knew where the Junction was, a little hamlet
about seven miles from Winthrop. How far it was
distant from the place where he then was, however,
he had no idea. It was easy to ascertain, and in response
to his question the farmer explained that it
was "about three mile."</p>

<p>"You might take us there, then," said Will quickly.
"I don't know just how the trains run for Winthrop,
but it'll be three miles nearer anyway."</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll be glad to take you there."</p>

<p>"How much are you going to charge us?" demanded
Mott who did not plan to be caught again by
the "guilelessness" of any of the people of the region.<a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a>"Oh, I sha'n't charge ye anything. Glad t' do ye
the favor," responded the farmer heartily.</p>

<p>In a brief time his car was ready, and, acting
upon his suggestion, the boys at once took their
places on the seat, and the driver soon was briskly
speeding down the roadway.</p>

<p>Conversation lagged, for the boys were somewhat
wearied by their long tramp and the young farmer
was silent, doubtless anxious over the illness in his
home. When a brief time had elapsed he deposited
the boys on the platform of the little station at the
Junction, and again declining any offer on their part
to pay for the service he had rendered them at once
departed in his search for the physician.</p>

<p>Approaching the little window in the ticket office
Mott inquired, "What's the next train we can get for
Winthrop?"</p>

<p>"No more trains to-night," responded the man
without looking up from the noisy clicker over which
he was bending.</p>

<p>"No more trains?"</p>

<p>"That's what I said. The last one passed here
fifteen minutes ago."</p>

<p>"Isn't there any way we can get there?"</p>

<p>"I s'pose there is."</p>

<p>"What is it?" demanded Mott eagerly.</p>

<p>"Walk."</p>

<p>"How far is it?"</p>

<p>"Seven miles."</p>

<p>"And there's no other way?"</p>

<p>"You won't be the first that have counted the ties
between Junction and Winthrop."<a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a>"Isn't there a freight train that comes along
pretty soon?" inquired Will.</p>

<p>"There's one that's due in 'bout an hour. But you
never can depend on it. It may be here in an hour
and it may be three hours. You never can tell."</p>

<p>"What shall we do, Phelps?" inquired Mott, turning
sharply to his companion.</p>

<p>"I don't care much, but I believe it would be better
for us to start. It isn't so very far and besides
it'll be good for our longevity and help us for the
meet."</p>

<p>There was an exclamation of anger from Mott who
doubtless had become somewhat sensitive to the frequent
references to his favorite expression of the
day, but he made no protest and the two boys at
once started up the track. Both were hungry and
weary but the distance must be traversed, and there
was no time or breath to waste in complaining.
Steadily they trudged onward, the monotony of the
walk increased by the deepening darkness. They
had been gone from the station only about an hour
when the shrill screech of the whistle from a locomotive
approaching from behind them was heard,
and in a few minutes the long and noisy freight
train thundered past them.</p>

<p>Mott was almost beside himself with rage as he
watched the passing cars and heaped all manner of
maledictions upon the head of the station agent, who,
he declared, must have known the train was coming,
and with malice aforethought had withheld his
knowledge and advised the boys to walk. "Everybody
was against the college boys," he declared, "and
looked upon it as legitimate to take advantage of
<a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a>them in every possible manner." But Will only
laughed in response and made no protests though he
was as thoroughly wearied as his companion.</p>

<p>At last the lights of the college could be seen and
shortly after ten o'clock they arrived at their dormitory.
"We'll remember this walk, I take it," said
Mott glumly as he turned toward his room.</p>

<p>"We certainly shall," replied Will. "The 'longevity'
of that old farmer was something wonderful."</p>

<p>"Bother his longevity!" exclaimed Mott as he
turned quickly away.</p>

<p>Left to himself Will slowly climbed the stairs until
he arrived at his own room, but as he was about to
enter he suddenly stopped and listened intently to the
sound of voices within. Surely he knew that voice,
he thought, and in an instant opened the door and
burst into the room.</p>

<p>Seated in the easy-chair was his father. Instantly
Will's weariness was forgotten and with a shout he
rushed upon his visitor throwing his arm about his
neck and laughing in a way that may have served to
keep down a stronger emotion.</p>

<p>"How long have you been here?" he demanded.
"Where's mother? When did you come? How's
everybody at home? Anything wrong? My, but
I'm glad to see you! How long are you going to
stay?"</p>

<p>The questions and exclamations fell from Will's
lips in such confusion that it was impossible to reply
and even Foster who was in the room joined in the
laugh with which his room-mate's excitement was
greeted.<a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a>"Not too fast, Will," laughed his father. "I had
to come near here on business and I thought it would
be a good thing to stop at Winthrop over night and
have a little visit with my boy. I didn't know that I
should be able to have one," he added smilingly, "for
he wasn't anywhere to be found."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry! I wish I'd known it. I've been out
for a walk with Mott. And we certainly have had
one!" he added as he recounted some of the experiences
of the afternoon.</p>

<p>His recital was greeted with laughter and even
Will himself could enjoy it now that it was all past
and he was once more safe in his room. For an hour
Mr. Phelps remained in the room listening to the
tales of the boys of their new life in the college,
laughing as he heard of their pranks, and deeply interested
in all they had to relate. At last when he
arose to go to his room in the village hotel, he promised
to come and attend church in the morning with
the boys and then explained that he would have two
hours to spend with Will on the morning following
as his train did not leave until half-past ten.</p>

<p>"But I have a recitation the first hour," said Will
blankly. "I'll 'cut' it, though, for it isn't every day
one has his daddy with him, and I wouldn't lose a
minute of your time here, pop, for ten hours with old
Splinter. I have Greek, you know, the first hour in
the morning. Oh, I've got 'cuts' to burn," he added
hastily as an unspoken protest appeared in the expression
on his father's face. "You needn't worry
about that."</p>

<p>"I don't want you to lose any recitation because I
am here," said his father quietly. "I sha'n't want
<a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a>to come again if my coming interferes with your
work, and as it is I have serious doubts&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All right, pop," replied Will patting his father
affectionately on the shoulder. "I'll go to Splinter's
class, though I know he'll 'go for' me too. I won't
do a thing that'll ever keep you from showing up
here in Winthrop again."</p>

<p>On Monday morning after the exercises in the
chapel, Mr. Phelps went to Will's room and waited
till the hour should pass and the eager-hearted boy
should return. As the great clock in the tower rang
out the hour he arose and stood in front of the window
peering out across the campus at the building
where Will was at work, but the stroke had scarcely
ceased before he beheld the lad run swiftly down the
steps and speed along the pathway toward his room
as if he were running for a prize. The expression
in the man's eyes was soft and there was also a suspicious
moisture in them as well as he watched his
boy. Was it only a dream or reality? Only a few
short years ago and he had been an eager-hearted
boy speeding over the same pathway (he smiled as
he thought how the "speed" was never displayed on
his way to the recitation building), and now it was
his own boy who was sharing in the life of old Winthrop
and doubtless he himself was in the minds of
the young students relegated to that remote and distant
period when the "old grads" were supposed to
be young. Doubtless to them it was a time as remote
as that when Homer's heroes contended in battle
or the fauns and satyrs peopled the wooded hills
and plains. And yet how vital it all was to him.
He watched the groups of students moving across the
<a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a>campus, and as the sound of their shouts or laughter
or the words of some song rose on the autumn air, it
seemed to the man that he needed only to close his
eyes and the old life would return&mdash;a life so like the
present that it did not seem possible that a great
gulf of thirty years lay between.</p>

<p>Mr. Phelps' meditations were interrupted by the
entrance of Will, who burst into the room with the
force of a small whirlwind.</p>

<p>"Here I am, pop!" he exclaimed as he tossed his
books upon his couch and threw his cap to the opposite
side of the room. "Old Splinter stuck me
good this morning, but I can stand it as long as you
are here."</p>

<p>"Who is Splinter?"</p>

<p>"Why, don't you know? I thought everybody
knew Splinter. He's our professor of Greek and the
biggest fraud in the whole faculty."</p>

<p>"What's the trouble with him?" Mr. Phelps spoke
quietly but there was something in his voice that betrayed
a deeper feeling and one that Will was quick
to perceive and that gave him a twinge of uneasiness
as well.</p>

<p>"Oh, he's hard as nails. He must have 'ichor' in
his veins, not blood. I don't believe he ever was a
boy. He must have been like Pallas Athen&aelig;.
Wasn't she the lady that sprang full-fledged from the
brain of Zeus? Well, I've a notion that Splinter
yelled in Greek when he was a baby. That is, if he
ever was an infant, and called for his bottle in dactylic
hexameter. Oh, I know lots about Greek, pop,"
laughed Will as his father smiled. "I know the al<a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a>phabet
and a whole lot of things even if Splinter
thinks I don't."</p>

<p>"Doesn't he think you know much about your
Greek?"</p>

<p>"Well, he doesn't seem to be overburdened with the
weight of his opinion of me. He just looks upon me,
I'm afraid, as if I was not a bright and shining light.
'Learn Greek or grow up in ignorance,' that's the
burden of his song, and I've sometimes thought that
about all the fun he has in life is flunking freshmen."</p>

<p>"How about the freshmen?"</p>

<p>"You mean me? Honestly, pop, I haven't done
very well in my Greek; but I don't think it's all my
fault. I've worked on it as I haven't worked on anything
else in college. I've done my part, but Splinter
doesn't seem to believe it. What am I going to
do about it?"</p>

<p>Will in spite of his light-hearted ways, was seriously
troubled and his father was silent for a brief
time before he responded to the boy's question.</p>



<hr /><p><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a></p>
<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h3>

<h4>THE PERPETUAL PROBLEM</h4>


<p>"I was aware that you were having trouble with
your Greek," said Mr. Phelps quietly, "and that was
one of my reasons for stopping over here."</p>

<p>"You were? How did you know?"</p>

<p>"I had received word from the secretary of the faculty.
He sent me a formal note announcing that
your work was so low that it was more than probable
you would fail in your mid-year examination."</p>

<p>For a moment Will Phelps was silent. His face
became colorless and his heart seemed almost to rise
in his throat. Fail in his mid-year's? A "warning"
sent home to his father? To the inexperienced
young student it seemed for a moment as if he was
disgraced in the eyes of all his friends. He knew
that his work had been of a low grade, but never for
a moment had he considered it as being at all serious.
So many of his newly formed friends in the
college had been speaking of their conditions and
low grades as a matter of course and had referred to
them laughingly, much as if they were good jokes
to be enjoyed that Will too had come almost to feel
that his own trouble was not a serious one. And
Splinter was the one to be blamed for the most of it,
he was convinced. The words of his father, however,
had presented the matter in an entirely different
light, and his trouble was vastly increased by its
evident effect upon him. Will's face was drawn and
there was an expression of suffering upon it as he
glanced again at his father and said:<a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a>"What shall I do? Will it drop me out of college?"</p>

<p>"I think not necessarily. You must pass off more
than half your hours to enable you to keep on with
your class; but failure in one study will not bring
that of itself, for your Greek is a four-hour course.
But the matter is, of course, somewhat serious and
in more ways than one."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know it," replied Will despondently.</p>

<p>"Well, if you know it, that's half the battle won
already. The greatest trouble with most unsuccessful
men is that they have never learned what their
own weaknesses and limitations are. But you say
you know, and I wish you'd tell me what you think
the chief difficulty is."</p>

<p>"My Greek," said Will, trying to smile.</p>

<p>"But what's the trouble with the Greek?"</p>

<p>"The trouble is that the Greek troubles me. I
suppose the Greek is all right and I'm all wrong."</p>

<p>"In what way?"</p>

<p>"I don't know it as I ought to."</p>

<p>"Is that 'Splinter's' fault?"</p>

<p>"No, it's mine. You know how hard I worked in
the closing half of my last year in the high school,
but that didn't, and I suppose couldn't, make up for
what I hadn't done before."</p>

<p>"Are you working hard now?"</p>

<p>"On my Greek?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I'm putting more time on that than on everything
else."</p>

<p>"I didn't ask you about the 'time,' but about the
work."<a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a>"Why, yes. I don't just see what you mean. I
spend three hours on my Greek every day we have
it."</p>

<p>"It's one thing to 'spend the time' and another to
work. Some men will accomplish more in an hour
than others will in three."</p>

<p>"I do my best," said Will gloomily. He felt almost
as if his father was unfair with him and was
disposed to question what he had said.</p>

<p>"Now, Will," said Mr. Phelps quietly, but in a tone
of voice which his boy clearly understood, "it would
be an easy thing for me to smooth over this matter
and make light of it, but my love and interest in you
are too strong to permit me to think of that for a
moment. I believe in you, my boy, but there are
some things in which I cannot aid you, some things
which you must learn and do for yourself. Last
year you faced your crisis as a man should, and I
believe you will face this one too."</p>

<p>"It seems as if there was always something to be
faced."</p>

<p>"There is. That's it, exactly. My boy, Splinter,
as you call your professor in Greek, is not limited to
the faculty of Winthrop College. In one form or
another he presents himself all through your life.
His name is simply that of the perpetual problem."</p>

<p>"I don't see, then&mdash;" interrupted Will.</p>

<p>"No, you don't see; but it is just because I do, and
I am your father, that I am talking in this way.
Why do you think I have sent you to college? It
isn't for the name of it, or for the fun you will get
out of it, or even for the friendships you will form
here, though every one of these things is good in it<a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a>self.
It is to have you so trained, or rather for you
so to train yourself, that when you go out from Winthrop
you will be able to meet the very problems of
which I am speaking and master them. They come
to all, and the great difference in men is really in
their ability to solve these very things. I think it is
Emerson who says, 'It is as easy for a large man to
do large things as it is for a small man to do small
things.' And that is what I want for you, my boy,
the ability to do the greater things."</p>

<p>"But I'll never use Greek any. I wish I could
take some other study in its place."</p>

<p>"Just now it is not a question of Greek or something
in its place. It is a question of facing and
overcoming a difficulty or permitting it to overcome
you. You must decide whether you will be a victor
or a victim. There are just three things a man can
do when he finds himself compelled to meet one of
these difficult things that in one form or another
come to everybody. He can turn and run from it,
but that's the part of a coward. He can get around
it, evade it somehow, but that's the part of the timid
and palterer, and sooner or later the superficial man
is found out. Then there is the best way, which is
to meet and master it. Everybody has to decide
which he will do, but do one of the three he must,
and there is no escape."</p>

<p>"You think I ought to hit it between the eyes?"</p>

<p>"Yes, though I should not put it in quite that
way," said his father with a smile.</p>

<p>"I'd like to smash it! I don't like it! I'll never
make a Greek scholar, and I detest Splinter. He's
<a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a>as dry as a bone or a Greek root! He hasn't any
more juice than a piece of boiled basswood!"</p>

<p>"That does not alter the matter. It won't change,
and you've got to choose in which of the three ways
I have suggested you will meet it."</p>

<p>"I suppose that's so," said Will quietly. "But it
doesn't make it any easier."</p>

<p>"Not a bit."</p>

<p>"I know what you would say."</p>

<p>"Then it isn't necessary for me to say another
word. There's one thing I am thankful for, Will,
and that is that you and I are such good friends that
we can talk this trouble all over together. The dean
was telling me this morning&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Have you seen the dean?" interrupted Will
quickly. "What did he say?"</p>

<p>"The dean was telling me," resumed Mr. Phelps
smiling and ignoring the interruption, "that he sees
so many of what might be termed the tragical elements
of college life, that he sometimes feels as if
he could not retain his position another day. Fathers
and mothers broken-hearted, boys discouraged or
worse, but the most tragical experience of all, he
says, is to try to deal with fathers who have no special
interest in their boys, and between whom there is
no confidence. Whatever troubles may come to us,
Will, I am thankful that that at least will not be one
of them."</p>

<p>As he spoke Mr. Phelps arose, for the machine
which was to convey him to the station could now be
seen approaching and the time of his departure had
arrived. His good-bye was hastily spoken for he
knew how hard it would be for Will to be left be<a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a>hind,
and in a brief time he had taken his seat in the
auto. He saw Will as he hastily ran back to his
room and then he could see him as he stood by the
window in his room watching the departing auto
as long as it could be seen. He gave no signal to
show that he saw his boy, but his own eyes were wet
as he was carried swiftly down the street, as he
thought of the predicament in which Will was and
how the testing-time had come again. But the young
student must be left to fight out his battle alone. To
save him from the struggle would be to save him
from the strength. If it were only possible for a
father to save his boy by assuming his burden, how
thankful he would be, was Mr. Phelps' reflection,
but he was too wise a man and too good a father
to flinch or falter now, and, though his heart was
heavy, he resolutely kept on his way leaving Will to
fight his own battle, and hoping that the issue would
be as he most fervently desired.</p>

<p>Left to himself, for a moment Will was almost despondent.
The departure of his father seemed to
leave the loneliness intensified, but he was recalled
as he heard some one run up the stairway and rush
into the room. His visitor was Mott, and perhaps
the sophomore almost instinctively felt that his presence
was not welcome, for he said:</p>

<p>"Governor gone, Phelps? Hope he left a good-sized
check with you! I've come over to be the first
to help you get rid of it."</p>

<p>"What's the trouble?" inquired Will quietly,
glancing up as he spoke. "Your money all gone?
Want to borrow some?"</p>

<p>"I'm always ready for that," laughed Mott,<a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a>
"though I'll have to own up that I've got a few cents
on hand yet. No, I don't know that I want to borrow
any; but I thought you might want a little help
in getting rid of that check, and I'd just run over to
oblige you. Just pure missionary work, you see."
Mott seated himself in the large easy-chair and endeavored
to appear at his ease, though to Will it still
seemed as if there was something which still troubled
his visitor.</p>

<p>"I haven't any special check."</p>

<p>"That's all right. My 'old man' never has been
up to see me since I entered Winthrop, but as I look
around at the fellows whose fathers and mothers
have been up, I've noticed that they're usually pretty
flush right after the old gentleman departs."</p>

<p>"Hasn't your mother ever been up?" inquired Will
in surprise.</p>

<p>"No. Why should she? She hasn't any time to
bother with me. She's on more than forty boards,
and is on the 'go' all the time. She has to attend all
sorts of 'mothers' meetings' too, and I believe she
has a lecture also, which she gives."</p>

<p>"A lecture?"</p>

<p>"Yes. She has a lecture on 'The proper method
of bringing up boys.' How do you suppose she ever
has any time to visit me?" Mott laughed as if the
matter was one of supreme indifference to him, but
Will fancied that he could detect a feeling of bitterness
beneath it all. For himself, the condition described
by the sophomore seemed to him to be incredible.
His own relations with his father had
been of the frankest and most friendly nature. In<a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a>deed,
it never occurred to him in a time of trouble or
perplexity that there was any one else to whom he so
naturally could go as to his own father. Since he
had entered Winthrop, however, he had discovered
several who were not unlike Mott in their feelings toward
their own families; and as Mott spoke he almost
unconsciously found a feeling of sympathy arising
in his heart for him. Some of his apparently
reckless deeds could be explained now.</p>

<p>"Mott, you must go home with me next vacation,"
he said impulsively.</p>

<p>"That's good of you, but it's too far off to promise.
Say, Phelps, what's become of that man Friday of
yours?"</p>

<p>"Who's he?"</p>

<p>"Schenck."</p>

<p>"Oh, he's flourishing."</p>

<p>"He's the freshest freshman that ever entered
Winthrop. What do you suppose he had the nerve
to say to me to-day?"</p>

<p>"I can't imagine."</p>

<p>"Well, he told me that he thought the Alpha
Omega was the best fraternity in college, and that
he'd made up his mind to join it."</p>

<p>As this was the fraternity to which Mott himself
belonged, Will laughed as he said, "Oh, well, don't be
too hard with Peter John. He doesn't know any
better now, but he'll learn."</p>

<p>"That's what he will," replied Mott with a very
decided shake of his head. "I thought I'd come over
to tell you that the sophomore-freshmen meet is to
come off on Saturday afternoon."<a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a></p>

<p>"Not next Saturday?" exclaimed Will aghast.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's the very day."</p>

<p>"They told me it wasn't to be for two weeks yet."</p>

<p>"All the same it's on Saturday. I thought I'd tell
you, though I'm going to do my best to keep you
from winning your numerals."</p>

<p>Mott rose and departed from the room, and when
Foster returned he found his room-mate hard at
work, with his Greek books spread out on the desk
before him.</p>

<h4>THE MEET</h4>


<p>The fact that the track meet between the two
lower classes had been placed at an earlier date than
that for which it had first been announced was a
serious disappointment to Will Phelps. His success
in the school athletics had made him quietly hopeful,
if not confident, that he might be able to win
some laurels in college, and he also was aware that
the gold medal he wore upon his fob had made his
own classmates expect great things from him. And
the changed date now prevented him from doing any
training and he must enter the contest without any
preparation.</p>

<p>Reports had come to him that Mott and Ogden,
the two fleetest-footed sophomores, had already been
working hard, and rumors were also current that he
himself was to be kidnapped and prevented from entering
the games. Will had given but slight heed to
any of these reports, but he had in his own mind decided
that he would begin training at once for the
contest, for if he should by any chance win then he
would be the first member of his own class to gain
the coveted privilege of wearing his class numerals
upon his cap and sweater. And, not unnaturally,
Will was eager to secure the honor.</p>

<p>As he thought over Mott's words he was half inclined
to believe that the sophomore himself had
been the cause of the unexpected change in the date
of holding the games, and his feeling of anger and
desire to win both became keener. There was no
<a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a>time, however, afforded in which he might make
preparations for the meet, and he must simply do
his best under existing circumstances. There was
to be no burlesque or "horse play" in this contest,
and the entire college would be on hand and interested
to note the promise of the entering class in a department
of college life that appealed strongly to all
the students. Even his new determination to push
his work in his Greek harder than ever he had done
and his feeling of homesickness did not in the day
that intervened between the present and the day of
the games prevent his interest and excitement from
increasing during the passing hours.</p>

<p>Saturday afternoon finally arrived, clear and cool,
an ideal day for the contest. When Will stepped
forth from the dressing-room, clad in his light running
suit and with his bath robe wrapped around
him, as he glanced over the track he could see that
a crowd was already assembled. The sophomores
were seated in a body in one portion of the "bleachers,"
and their noisy shouts or loud class cries rose
steadily on the autumn air. Opposite was the freshman
class, but its members were still too unfamiliar
with their surroundings and with one another to
enable them to join in anything like the unison of
their rivals. In the grand stand were numbers of
the members of the families of the faculty and the
townspeople and visitors, and altogether the scene
was one that strongly stirred Will and his room-mate,
Foster Bennett, who also was to compete in
the games.</p>

<p>Suddenly a loud, derisive shout arose from the
sophomores, and Will glanced quickly up to discover
<a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a>its cause. In a moment the cause was seen, when
Peter John Schenck came running across the field
toward the place where Will and Foster were standing
beside a few of their classmates, who were also
waiting for the game to begin.</p>

<p>The sight of Peter John was one that caused even
Will and Foster to smile, for their classmate was
dressed as if he too was about to become a contestant,
and this was something neither of them
had expected. It was Peter John's garb, however,
which had so greatly delighted the beholders, for it
was unlike anything to be seen upon the field&mdash;"fearfully
and wonderfully made," as Mott, who had
joined them for a moment, had expressed it. Evidently
it was the result of Peter John's own handiwork.
His running trousers came to a place about
halfway between his knees and ankles before they
stopped, and were fashioned of coarse bagging or
material very similar to it. He wore no running
shoes, but a pair of gray woolen socks, plainly
"hand made," provided a substitute. His "running
shirt" was a calico blouse which had at one time
doubtless served him as a garment in which he had
done the daily chores upon his father's farm, but,
as if to make matters still worse, a broad band of ribbon,
the colors of the class, was diagonally fastened
to his blouse in front, and Peter John's fierce shock
of bright red hair, uncut since he had entered Winthrop,
served to set off the entire picture he presented.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess we'll do 'em to-day, Will," exclaimed
Peter John as he approached the group of
which his friend was a member.<a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a></p>

<p>"I guess we will," remarked Mott soberly.</p>

<p>"I'm going to do my prettiest," continued Peter
John.</p>

<p>"If you let anybody once get ahead of you,
Schenck," said Mott, "you'll never catch him. If he
sees you after him he'll run for his life."</p>

<p>"He'll have to!"</p>

<p>"What are you entered for?" inquired Mott, glancing
at his program as he spoke.</p>

<p>"The half-mile run."</p>

<p>"Ever do it before?"</p>

<p>"Once or twice."</p>

<p>"What time did you make?"</p>

<p>"I don't just recollect."</p>

<p>"Never mind. You'll make a new record to-day."</p>

<p>"That's what I want to do," replied Peter John,
sublimely unconscious that he was being made sport
of by the sophomore.</p>

<p>The conversation was interrupted by the call,
"All out for the hundred-yard dash!" and, as Will
was to run in the first heat, he drew off his bath
robe and tossing it to Foster, turned at once for the
starting-place. He had already been indulging in a
few trials of starting, but his feeling of confidence
was by no means strong as he glanced at those who
were to be his competitors. There were four runners
in his heat, and one of them was Ogden, the sophomore
of whose reputation as a "sprinter" Will already
was aware. The other two were freshmen
and therefore unknown quantities, but Will's chief
interest was in Ogden. He could see the knots of
muscles in his arms and back and legs, and his own
feeling of confidence was in nowise strengthened
<a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a>by the sight. Certainly Ogden was a muscular
fellow, and a competitor as dangerous as he was
striking in his appearance.</p>

<p>The call, "On your marks," was given, and Will,
with the other three, advanced and took his place on
the line. Every nerve in his body seemed to be
tingling with excitement and his heart was beating
furiously.</p>

<p>"Get set!" called the starter, and then in a moment
there followed the sharp report of the pistol
and the runners were speeding down the course.
Will felt that he had secured a good start, and but
a few yards had been covered when he realized
that he and Ogden were running almost side by
side and had left the other two contestants behind
them. Nor were their relative positions changed
as they sped on down the track except that the distance
between Will and Ogden and the two freshmen
behind them was steadily increased. Will was
dimly aware as he drew near the line that the
entire sophomore body had risen and was noisily
calling to their classmate to increase his speed.
There was silence from the seats occupied by the
freshman class, but Will was hardly mindful of the
lack of support. Glancing neither to the right nor
the left, he could almost instinctively feel that Ogden
was a few inches in advance of him and all his efforts
were centered upon cutting down the intervening
distance.</p>

<p>As the contestants came within the last ten yards
of the course, Will gathered himself together for
one final burst of speed. His feet seemed scarcely to
touch the ground as he darted forward. But Ogden
<a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a>was not to be outdone, for he too increased the pace
at which he was running, and when they touched
the line that was stretched across the course, the
sophomore was still ahead by a few inches and had
come in first in the heat, while Will was second.</p>

<p>Foster was standing near to catch his room-mate,
and as he wrapped the bath robe around him, he
said: "It's all right, Will; you're in the finals."</p>

<p>"First two taken?" gasped Will.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Hold on. Let's hear the time," said Will, stopping
abruptly as the announcer advanced.</p>

<p>"Hundred-yards dash, first heat," called the senior,
"Won by number ten. Second, number fifteen.
Time, ten and two-fifths seconds."</p>

<p>"That's good for the heat, Will," said Foster
warmly.</p>

<p>"I'm not in training," said Will despondently.</p>

<p>"The others aren't either, or at least not much.
You had Ogden nearly winded, and when it comes
to the finals you'll do him up," said Foster encouragingly.</p>

<p>Will did not reply, for the call for the second heat
was now made and he was intensely interested in
watching Mott's performance, for his reputation in
the college was even greater than Ogden's. And if
he himself had been beaten by Ogden, what chance
would he have against Mott? The question was not
reassuring, but as the five men in the second heat
could now be seen taking their positions on the line,
it was for the moment ignored, as intensely interested
he turned to watch the race that was about
to be run.<a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a></p>

<p>In a moment the pistol was fired and the five contestants
came speeding down the course. It was
soon seen that Mott was leading, but only by a little,
though he did not appear to be exerting himself
strongly.</p>

<p>"Easy, dead easy!" Will heard a sophomore near
him remark, and as he watched Mott's easy stride
he heartily concurred in the opinion.</p>

<p>The runners were nearing the line now, and as
Mott drew near he almost stopped for a moment and
glanced smilingly behind him at his contestants.
Instantly his nearest competitor darted forward and
before the sophomore could recover himself he had
touched the string and won the heat, with Mott a
close second. Mott, however, appeared to be in
nowise disconcerted and laughingly received the
bantering words of his classmates. He laughed
again when the time was announced as ten and four-fifths
seconds, and approaching the place where Will
and Foster were standing, said:</p>

<p>"You did well, freshman. Made better time than
I did."</p>

<p>"I had to, if I kept anywhere near Ogden."</p>

<p>The other events of the meet were now being run
off, and as Peter John Schenck took his place on the
line for the half-mile run the uproar became almost
tumultuous, and when the freshman apparently took
it all in his most serious manner and bowed gravely
to the sophomores, evidently appropriating to himself
all the noisy demonstrations of delight, the
shouts and laughter redoubled.</p>

<p>In a moment, however, the runners were off and
Peter John quickly advanced to the first place, fol<a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a>lowed
by a line of five that were well bunched together.
There were many derisive calls and cries
and Peter John's work seemed to be taken as a joke
by all the spectators, who were loud in their declarations
that he was "making a mistake" and would
"never be able to maintain his stride." Around the
course sped the runners until at last they were on
the home stretch and still Peter John was in advance,
his arms working like the fans of a Dutch
windmill and his awkward movements becoming
more awkward as the strain of the final part of the
race came upon him. Still he was in the lead, however,
and the derisive cries were giving place to
shouts of approval and encouragement from his
own classmates.</p>

<p>The increasing excitement seemed to provide an
additional spur to the awkward freshman, for his
speed suddenly increased and he darted across the
line far in advance of his rivals who were bunched
behind him. Laughter was mingled with the applause
that greeted him, and when the captain of
the college track team advanced and extended his
hand in congratulation, the genuineness of the
applause that followed was unquestioned.</p>

<p>Peter John, highly elated by his success, approached
Will and said glibly: "There, Will, I
rather guess that'll add five points to our score."</p>

<p>"I rather guess it will," laughed his classmate cordially.
He was as greatly surprised as any one
that day, but he was too generous to begrudge any
praise to Peter John.</p>

<p>"Now see that you do as well," said Peter John,
<a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a>as the call for the finals in the hundred-yard dash
was made.</p>

<p>Will made no response as he advanced to take his
place. Foster had already won the running broad
jump and was in a fair way to win the shot-put as
well. Peter John had been successful too, and to
Will it seemed that he must win his race or his disappointment
would be almost too bitter to bear.</p>

<p>At the report of the pistol the contestants darted
from the line and came speeding down the track
toward the finish, which was near the place where
the spectators were assembled. Vigorously, lusty,
the perfection physically of young manhood, the
four runners sped on with the swiftness of the
wind, but when they touched the tape it was evident
that Mott was first by a small margin and that
Ogden was second, being an almost imperceptible
distance in advance of Will Phelps, who had finished
third in the race.</p>

<h4>WAGNER'S ADVICE</h4>


<p>The applause that greeted the winners was sounding
but dimly and like some far-away shout in Will
Phelps' ears when he staggered into the outstretched
arms of Hawley, who was waiting to receive his
classmate. Mortification, chagrin, disappointment
were all mingled in his feelings, and it was all intensified
by the fact that both Foster and Peter John
had won their "numerals" and were now marked
men in the class. Not that he begrudged either the
honors he had won, but his own reputation as a
sprinter had preceded his coming to Winthrop, and
Will knew that great things had been expected of
him.</p>

<p>"It was a great race, Phelps," said Hawley, "and
you've added another point to our score."</p>

<p>Will could understand the attempt at consolation
which his huge classmate was making, but it only
served to increase the bitterness of his own defeat.
He smiled, but made no response. He could see
Peter John strutting about and receiving the half-bantering
congratulations of the students, and his
heart became still heavier.</p>

<p>"Never mind, Phelps, you didn't have any chance
to train," said Hawley. "Mott and Ogden have been
down on the track every evening for the past three
weeks."</p>

<p>"They have?" demanded Will, a ray of light appearing
for the moment.<a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a>"Sure. And besides all that they got the date of
the 'meet' changed too."</p>

<p>"They beat me," said Will simply.</p>

<p>"Everybody expected them to. They all know
you're a good runner, Phelps, but they say a freshman
never wins. Such a thing hasn't been known
for years. You see, a freshman is all new to it here,
and I don't care how good he is, he can't do himself
justice. You ought to hear what Wagner, the captain
of the college track team, had to say about you."</p>

<p>"What did he say?" inquired Will eagerly.</p>

<p>"He said you had it in you to make one of the best
runners in college, and he's going to keep an eye on
you for the team too."</p>

<p>"Did he say that?"</p>

<p>"That's what he did."</p>

<p>"The two-twenty hasn't been run yet. I believe
I'll go in for that."</p>

<p>"That's the way to talk."</p>

<p>"Let me see when it comes," said Will, turning
to his program as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Fifteen minutes yet," said Hawley. "Come into
the dressing room, Phelps, and I'll give you a good
rubbing down."</p>

<p>Will at once accompanied his friend to the dressing
room, and when the call for the two hundred
and twenty yards' dash was made, he took his place
on the line with the other competitors. There were
only four, the same four that had run in the final
heat of the hundred yards, the defeated contestants
all having dropped out save one.</p>

<p>When the pistol was fired and the racers had
started, Will was at once aware that again the vic<a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a>tory
was not to be his. The lack of training and
practice, and perhaps also the depression which his
previous defeat had produced in his mind contributed
to his failure; but whatever the cause, though
he exerted himself to the utmost, he found that he
was unable to overtake either Mott or Ogden, who
steadily held their places before him. It was true
when the race was finished that he was less than a
yard behind Mott, who was himself only about a
foot in the rear of the fleet-footed Ogden, and that
the fourth runner was so far behind Will that he
was receiving the hootings and jibes of the sophomores,
but still the very best that Phelps was able
to do was to cross the line as third. It was true
that again he had won a point for the honor of his
class, but it was first place he had longed to gain,
and his disappointment was correspondingly keen.</p>

<p>It was Hawley who again received him in his
arms, and once more the young giant endeavored to
console his defeated classmate, for as such Will
looked upon himself, in spite of the fact that he had
come in third, and therefore had scored a point in
each race. But as Hawley perceived that his friend
was in no mood to listen, he wisely refrained from
speaking, and both stood near the track watching
the contestants in the various events that were not
yet run off. Too proud to acknowledge his disappointment
in his defeat by departing from the field,
and yet too sore in his mind to arouse much enthusiasm,
he waited till the games were ended and it
was known that the sophomores had won by a score
of sixty-four and a half to forty-eight and a half.
Then he quietly sought the dressing room, and as
<a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a>soon as he had donned his garments went at once
to his own room.</p>

<p>It was a relief to find that not even Foster was
there, and as he seated himself in his easy-chair
and gazed out at the brilliantly clad hills with the
purple haze that rested over them all, for a time
a feeling of utter and complete depression swept
over him. Was this the fulfillment of the dreams
he had cherished of the happiness of his college life?
Already warned by Splinter that his work in Greek
was so poor that he was in danger of being dropped
from the class, the keen disappointment of his
father apparent though his words had been few,
the grief in his home and the peril to himself were
all now visible to the heart-sick young freshman.
And now to lose in the two track events had added
a weight that to Will seemed to be almost crushing.
He had pictured to himself how he would lightly
turn away his poor work in the classroom by explaining
that he could not hope to win in everything,
and that athletics had always been his strong point
anyway. But now even that was taken away and
his failure was almost equally apparent in both.</p>

<p>He could see Peter John coming up the walk,
receiving the congratulations of the classmates he
met and giving his "pump-handle" handshake to
those who were willing to receive it. It was maddening
and almost more than Will thought he could
bear. It was a mistake that he had ever come to
college anyway, he bitterly assured himself. He
was not well prepared in spite of the fact that he
had worked hard for a part of his final year in the
preparatory school. Greek? He detested the sub<a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a>ject.
Even his father came in for a share of blame,
for if he had not insisted upon his taking it Will
never would have entered Splinter's room. He might
have taken German under "Dutchy," or English
under Professor Jones, as many of his classmates
were doing, and every one declared that the work
there was a "snap."</p>

<p>It was not long before Will Phelps was in a state
of mind wherein he was convinced that he was being
badly treated and had more to contend against than
any other man in his class. His naturally impulsive
disposition seldom found any middle ground on
which he was permitted to stand. His father had
one time laughingly declared that the comparative
degree had been entirely left out of Will's make-up
and that things were usually of the superlative.
"Worst," "best," "poorest," "finest" were adjectives
most commonly to be found in his vocabulary, and
between the two extremes a great gulf appeared to
be fixed. He had also declared that he looked for
Will to occupy no middle ground. He would either
be a pronouncedly successful man or an equally pronounced
failure, a very good man or a man who
would be a villain. And Will had laughingly accepted
the verdict, being well assured that he knew,
if it must be one of the two, which it would of
necessity be. All things had gone well with him
from the time of his earliest recollections. His home
had been one of comfort and even of elegance, any
reasonable desire had never been denied, he had
always been a leading spirit among the pupils of
the high school, and that he was too, a young fellow
who was graceful in his appearance, well dressed,
<a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a>and confident of his own position, doubtless Will
Phelps was aware, although he did not give expression
to the fact in such terms.</p>

<p>And now the "superlative degree" had certainly
displayed itself, Will thought in his wretchedness,
only it had manifested itself in the extreme which
he never had before believed to be possible with
him. He listened to the shouts and laughter of the
students passing along the street below and every
fresh outburst only served to deepen his own feeling
of depression. Not any of the enthusiasm was
for him.</p>

<p>He was roused from his bitter reflection by the
opening of the door into his room, but he did not
look up, as he was convinced that it was only his
room-mate, and Foster understood him so well that
he would not talk when he saw that he was in no
mood for conversation.</p>

<p>"Hello, Phelps! What's wrong?"</p>

<p>Will hastily sat erect and looked up. His visitor
was Wagner, the captain of the track team, the one
senior of all others for whom Will cherished a
feeling of respect that was almost unbounded. He
had never met the great man before, but he had
looked up to him with awe when Wagner had been
pointed out to him by admiring students, and he was
aware that the captain's reputation was as great in
the college for his manliness as it was for his success
in athletics. Unpretentious, straightforward,
without a sign of "cant" or "gush" about him, the
influence of the young leader had been a mighty
force for good in the life of Winthrop College. And
now as Will glanced into the face of the tall, power<a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a>ful
young fellow and realized that it was indeed
himself whom his visitor was addressing, his feeling
of depression instantly gave place to surprise and
in the unexpected honor he found it difficult to express
himself.</p>

<p>"Nothing much. I wasn't just looking for any&mdash;for
you," he stammered. "Won't you take this chair,
Mr. Wagner?" Will pushed the easy-chair toward
his visitor as he spoke and again urged him to be
seated.</p>

<p>"That's all right, Phelps. Keep your seat. I'll
just sit here," replied Wagner, seating himself upon
the edge of Will's desk. "How do you feel after the
games?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"I'm a bit sore outside and worse still inside."</p>

<p>"What's the trouble?"</p>

<p>"I came in only third."</p>

<p>"Only third? Where did you expect to come in?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why, I was hoping I'd get first in the hundred,"
Will managed to reply.</p>

<p>"You're a modest youth," laughed Wagner, surveying
his long legs and laughing in such a manner
that Will was compelled to join.</p>

<p>"Well, the fellows rather thought I'd win and
that's what makes me feel worse about it."</p>

<p>"They're only freshmen; they don't know any
better," laughed Wagner. "Don't let that bother
you for a minute. I think you did well myself, and
besides, the freshmen very seldom win in the sprints.
I don't know that I ever saw one since I've been in
college."</p>

<p>"Did you win the hurdles when you were a freshman?"<a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a>"Oh, I just happened to. 'Twas an accident of
some kind, I fancy. Yes, I think the soph who was
ahead of me tripped and fell, so I crawled in first."</p>

<p>"That will do for you to tell."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I did win. But that's neither here nor
there. It isn't what I came for. I didn't want to
talk about myself but about you."</p>

<p>Will looked up eagerly but did not speak, though
his question was to be seen in the expression of his
face.</p>

<p>"My advice to you is to go to work and try for
the track team in the spring."</p>

<p>"Do you think I can make it?" said Will breathlessly.</p>

<p>"I don't say that," laughed Wagner. "That's
something to be decided later. All I said was that
you'd better 'try' for it. You've nothing to lose if
you fail and something to win if you succeed."</p>

<p>"But if I should try and then not make it."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's a possibility, of course. No man can
ever tell about that. But I shouldn't let it break
my heart if I didn't make the team the first year.
Very few do that. All I say is go ahead and try.
No man can ever tell what's in him till he tests himself,
can he?"</p>

<p>"No, I suppose not."</p>

<p>"Now don't have any nonsense about it, Phelps,
and don't misunderstand me. I believe in every man
doing his best and then just resting there and not
crying over what he can't ever have. If a man does
his best and then doesn't have the whole world bowing
and scraping before him because he isn't very
high up, that isn't any reason why he should kick.<a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a>
Take what you've got, use it, test it, and then if
you find you're not a star but only a candle, why,
just shine as a candle and don't go sputtering around
because you can't twinkle like a star. At least
that's the way I look at it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps a fellow's father and mother don't look
at it that way."</p>

<p>"Are you having trouble with Splinter?" demanded
the senior sharply.</p>

<p>"A little. Yes, a good deal. I detest the fellow!"
said Will bitterly.</p>

<p>"No wonder you lost the hundred," responded
Wagner with a smile. "Do you know, Phelps, I had
the same experience you're having with him when I
was a freshman."</p>

<p>"What did you do?"</p>

<p>"Do? There's only one thing to do and that is to
do his work. But I advise you to go down to his
house and see him and talk it over."</p>

<p>"He won't want to see me."</p>

<p>"Yes, he will. He's not half so bad as you think.
Try it; I did."</p>

<p>"He'll think I'm trying to boot-lick."</p>

<p>"No, he won't. You can run if you have to, can't
you?" demanded Wagner. "You've got a good
stride, and, like trying for the track team, you've
nothing to lose and everything to gain."</p>

<h4>THE ADVICE FOLLOWED</h4>


<p>For a time after the departure of Wagner, Will
Phelps sat thinking over the stirring words of his
visitor. His feeling of positive discouragement,
with the natural rebound of his impulsive temperament,
had in a measure given place to one of confidence
and even of elation. To be recognized by the
great captain was an honor of itself, but to receive
a personal visit from him and a warm invitation to
try for a place on the track team was a distinction
for which he never had even dared to dream. Even
his other pressing problem&mdash;his work in Greek&mdash;appeared
slightly more rosy-hued now, and a sudden
determination seized upon him to do as Wagner had
suggested and see Splinter that very night.</p>

<p>Accordingly, soon after dinner&mdash;the meal at his
fraternity house which he had dreaded in view of
the semi-defeat of the afternoon&mdash;he started toward
the home of his professor of Greek, resolved to talk
over the entire situation with him and strive to learn
exactly where he stood and what his prospects were
likely to be.</p>

<p>As he approached the walk that led from the street
back to the professor's home he came face to face
with Mott and Peter John Schenck. His surprise at
meeting them was not greater than that he should
find them together, and the fact to his mind boded
little good for his classmate.</p>

<p>"Going in to see Splinter?" inquired Mott.</p>

<p>"Yes."<a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a>"Better not."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Boot-licking isn't in very high favor here at Winthrop."</p>

<p>Will was glad that the darkness concealed the flush
which he knew crept over his face, but his voice was
steady as he replied: "That's all right, Mott. I'm
not going in to see Splinter because I want to, you
may let your heart rest easy as to that."</p>

<p>"How long are you going to be in the house?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid that will not be for me to decide. If
I have my way, it won't be long."</p>

<p>"Well, good luck to you!" called Mott as he and
his companion passed on down the street.</p>

<p>Will rang the bell and was at once ushered into
the professor's study. The professor himself was
seated at his desk with a green shade over his eyes,
and evidently had been at work upon some papers.
Will even fancied that he could recognize the one
which he himself had handed in the preceding day
and his embarrassment increased.</p>

<p>"Ah, good evening, Mr. Phelps," said the professor
extending his hand and partly rising from his
seat as he greeted his caller. "Will you be seated?"</p>

<p>"Good evening, professor," replied the freshman
as he took the chair indicated.</p>

<p>An awkward silence followed which Will somehow
found it difficult to break in upon. He heartily
wished that he had not come, for the reality was
much worse than he had thought. Even the very
lines and furrows in the professor's face seemed to
him to be forbidding, and he felt that it would be
<a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a>well-nigh impossible for him to explain the purpose
of his coming.</p>

<p>"Was there something concerning which you desired
to consult me?" inquired the professor. The
voice seemed to be as impersonal as that of a phonograph,
and every letter in every word was so distinctly
pronounced that the effect was almost electric.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>Again silence intervened. The professor's lips
moved slightly as if, as Will afterwards declared,
"he was tasting his Greek roots," but he did not
speak. The freshman shifted his position, toyed
with his gloves and at last, unable to endure the suspense
any longer, he broke forth:</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, there is, professor. I have not been doing
very well in my Greek."</p>

<p>"Ah. Let me see." The professor opened a
drawer and drew forth a little notebook which he
consulted for a brief time. "Yes, you are correct.
Your work is below the required standard."</p>

<p>"But what am I to do about it?" demanded Will.</p>

<p>"Yes, ah, yes. I fancy it will be necessary for
you to spend a somewhat longer period of study in
preparation."</p>

<p>"But <i>how</i> shall I study?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Yes. Ah, yes. Exactly so. So you refer
to the method to be employed in the preparation for
the classroom?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. That's it. I'm willing enough to work,
but I don't know how."</p>

<p>"Well, I should say that the proper method would
be to employ a tutor for a time. There are several
<a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a>very excellent young gentlemen who are accustomed
to give their services to deserving youth&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't want them to give it. I'll pay for it!"
interrupted Will.</p>

<p>"I was about to say that these young gentlemen
give their services for a consideration&mdash;a proper
consideration&mdash;of course."</p>

<p>The professor's thin lips seemed to be reluctant to
permit the escape of a word, so firmly were they
pressed together during the intervals between his
slowly spoken words. His slight figure, "too thin
to cast a shadow," in the vigorous terms of the young
freshman, was irritating in the extreme, and if Will
had followed his own inclinations he would at once
have ended the interview.</p>

<p>"I knew I could get a tutor, and if it is necessary
I'll do it. But I did not know but that you might be
able to make a suggestion to me. I know I'm not
very well prepared, but if you'll give me a show and
tell me a little how to go to work at the detestable
stuff I'll do my best. I don't like it. I wouldn't
keep at it a minute if my father was not so anxious
for me to keep it up and I'd do anything in the world
for him. That's why I'm in the Greek class."</p>

<p>"You are, I fancy (fawncy was the word in the
dialect of the professor) doing better work in the
various other departments than in your Greek?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I think so."</p>

<p>"You are not positive?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I know I'm doing fairly well in my
Latin and mathematics. Why the recitation in
Latin never seems to be more than a quarter of an
hour, while the Greek seems as if it would never
<a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a>come to an end. I think Professor Baxter is the
best teacher I ever saw and he doesn't make the
Latin seem a bit like a dead language. But the
Greek seems as if it had never been alive."</p>

<p>"Ahem-m!" piped up the thin voice of the professor
of Greek.</p>

<p>Will Phelps, however, was in earnest now and his
embarrassment was all forgotten. He was expressing
his own inward feelings and without any intention
or even thought of how the words would sound
he was describing his own attitude of mind. He
certainly had no thought of how his words would be
received.</p>

<p>"Ahem-m!" repeated the professor shrilly and
shifting a trifle uneasily in his seat. "I fawncy that
a student always does better work in a subject which
he enjoys."</p>

<p>"Yes, but doesn't he enjoy what he can do better
work in too? Now I don't know how to study Greek,
can't seem to make anything out of it. As you told
me one day in the class 'I make Greek of it all.' Perhaps
not exactly the kind of Greek you want,
though," Will added with a smile.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes. I fawncy a trifle more of work would
aid you."</p>

<p>"Of course! I know it would! And that's what
I'm willing to do and what I want to do, professor.
But the trouble is I don't know just how to work."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I fail to see precisely what you mean."</p>

<p>"Why, I spend time enough but I don't seem to
'get there'&mdash;I mean I don't seem to accomplish much.
My translation's not much good, and everything is
wrong."<a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a>"Perhaps you have an innate deficiency&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You mean I'm a fool?" Will laughed good-naturedly,
and even the professor smiled.</p>

<p>"Ah, no. By no means, Mr. Phelps, quite the contrary
to that, I assure you. There are some men
who are very brilliant students in certain subjects,
but are very indifferent ones in others. For example,
I recollect that some twenty years ago&mdash;or to
be exact nineteen years ago&mdash;there was a student in
my classes who was very brilliant, very brilliant indeed.
His name as I recall it was Wilder. So proficient
was he in his Greek that some of the students
facetiously called him Socrates, and some still more
facetious even termed him Soc. I am sure, Mr.
Phelps, you have been in college a sufficient length
of time to apprehend the frolicsome nature of some
of the students here."</p>

<p>"I certainly have," Will remarked with a smile,
recalling his own compulsory collar-button race.</p>

<p>"I fawncied so. Well, this Mr. Wilder to whom I
refer was doing remarkable work, truly remarkable
work in Greek, but for some cause his standing in
mathematics was extremely low, and in other
branches he was not a brilliant success."</p>

<p>"What did he do?" inquired Will eager to bring
the tedious description to a close, and if possible receive
the suggestions for which he had come.</p>

<p>"My recollection is that he finally left college."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" Will endeavored to be duly impressed
by the startling fact, but as he recalled the professor's
statement that the brilliant Wilder was in college
something like twenty years before this time,
his brilliancy in being able to complete the course
<a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a>and now be out from the college did not seem to him
to indicate any undue precocity on the part of the
aforesaid student.</p>

<p>"Yes, it was so. It has been my pleasure to receive
an annual letter from him, and I trust you will
not think I am unduly immodest when I state that
he acknowledges that all his success in life is due to
the work he did here in my own classes in Winthrop.
My sole motive in referring to it is the desire to aid
you."</p>

<p>"You think I may be another Wilder?" inquired
Will lightly.</p>

<p>"Not exactly. That was not the thought that was
uppermost. But it may serve as an incentive to
you."</p>

<p>"What is this Wilder doing now?"</p>

<p>"Ahem-m!" The professor cleared his throat repeatedly
before he spoke. "He is engaged in an occupation
that brings him into contact with the very
best that has been thought and said, and also into
contact with some of the brightest and keenest intellects
of our nation."</p>

<p>"He must be an editor or a publisher then."</p>

<p>"Not exactly. Not exactly, Mr. Phelps. He is
engaged rather in a mercantile way, though with the
most scholarly works, I do assure you."</p>

<p>"Is he a book agent?"</p>

<p>"Ahem-m! Ahem-m! That is an expression I
seldom use, Mr. Phelps. It has become a somewhat
obnoxious term, though originally it was not so, I
fawncy. I should hardly care to apply that expression
as indicative of Mr. Wilder's present occupation."<a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a>"And you think if I try hard I may at last become
a book agent too?"</p>

<p>"You have mistaken my implication," said the professor
scowling slightly as he spoke. "I was striving
solely to provide an incentive for you. You may
recall what Homer, or at least he whom in our current
phraseology we are accustomed to call Homer&mdash;I
shall not now enter into the merits of that question
of the Homerid&aelig;. As I was about to remark,
however, you doubtless may recollect what Homer in
the fifth book of his Iliad, line forty-ninth, I think it
is, has to say."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I don't recall it. You see, professor, I
had only three books of the Iliad before I came to
Winthrop."</p>

<p>"Surely! Surely! Strange that I should have
forgotten that. It is a pleasure you have in store
then, Mr. Phelps."</p>

<p>"Can you give me any suggestions how to do better
work, professor?" inquired Will mildly.</p>

<p>"My advice to you is to secure Mr. Franklin of the
present junior class to tutor you for a time."</p>

<p>"Thank you. I'll try to see him to-night," said
Will rising and preparing to depart.</p>

<p>"That might be wise. I trust you will call upon
me again, Mr. Phelps. I have enjoyed this call exceedingly.
You will not misunderstand me if I say I
had slight knowledge of your classic tastes before,
and I am sure that I congratulate you heartily, Mr.
Phelps. I do indeed."</p>

<p>"Thank you," replied Will respectfully, and he
then departed from the house. He was divided be<a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a>tween
a feeling of keen disappointment and a desire
to laugh as he walked up the street toward his dormitory.
And this was the man who was to stimulate
his intellectual processes! In his thoughts he contrasted
him with his professor in Latin, and the man
as well as the language sank lower and lower in his
estimation. And yet he must meet it. The problem
might be solved but could not be evaded. He would
see Franklin at once, he decided.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV</h3>

<h4>A REVERSED DECISION</h4>


<p>In the days that immediately followed, Will Phelps
found himself so busy that there was but little time
afforded for the pleasures of comradeship or for
the lighter side of college life. Acting upon the one
good point in the advice of his professor of Greek he
secured a tutor, and though he found but little pleasure
in the study, still he gave himself to it so unreservedly
that when a few weeks had elapsed, a new
light, dim somewhat, it was true, and by no means
altogether cheering, began to appear upon his pathway.
It was so much more difficult to catch up than
to keep up, and perhaps this was the very lesson
which Will Phelps needed most of all to learn.
There was not much time given to recreation now,
and Will acting upon the advice of the instructor
in athletics had abandoned his projected practice in
running though his determination to try to secure
a place on the track team was as strong as ever.
But he had substituted for the running a line of
work in the gymnasium which tended to develop the
muscles in his legs and keep his general bodily condition
in good form. He was informed that success
in running was based upon nerve force as well as
upon muscular power, and that "early to bed" was
almost as much a requisite here as it was in making
a man "healthy and wealthy and wise." This condition
however he found it exceedingly difficult to fulfill,
for the additional work he was doing in Greek
made a severe draught upon his time as well as
upon his energies.<a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a>"I hate the stuff!" he declared one night to his
room-mate after he had spent several hours in an
almost vain effort to fasten certain rules in his mind.
"You don't catch me taking it after this year."</p>

<p>"You don't have to look ahead, Will," suggested
Foster kindly.</p>

<p>"No, the look behind is bad enough. If I had
worked in the early part of the high-school course
as I ought to I'd not be having all this bother now."</p>

<p>"And if you work now you won't have the trouble
ahead," laughed Foster.</p>

<p>"I suppose that's the way of it."</p>

<p>"Of course it is. A fellow reaps what he sows."</p>

<p>"I'd rather <i>rip</i> what I sewed," said Will ruefully.
"Do you know, Foster, sometimes I think the game
isn't worth the candle. I'd give it all up, even if I
had to leave college, if it wasn't for my father."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't do anything of the kind and you
know it, Will Phelps! You're not the fellow to run
when the pinch comes."</p>

<p>"I'd like to, though," said Will thoughtfully. "My
fit in Greek was so poor I'll never get much of the
good from studying it."</p>

<p>"You'll be all the stronger for not giving up, anyway."</p>

<p>"That's the only thing that keeps me at it. I'm so
busy I don't even have time to be homesick."</p>

<p>"Well, that's one good thing."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is, but if I flunk out at the mid-year's&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You won't if you only keep it up and keep at it."</p>

<p>"I'd feel better if I thought I wouldn't."<a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a>"You'll be all right," said Foster soothingly, for
he understood his friend so well that he knew he
was in one of his periods of mental reaction, and that
what he needed was encouragement more than anything
else.</p>

<p>"And just think of it," continued Will gloomily,
"you're about the only one of the fellows I ever see
nowadays. I don't believe I've seen Hawley in three
weeks, that is to have a word with him."</p>

<p>"Who has?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. All the fellows, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Not much! Hawley is working like a Trojan on
the football team. You know that as well as I do."</p>

<p>"I suppose that's so. Still I'd like to see the fellow
once in a while."</p>

<p>"He's a good man all right and I've a notion that
he's saved Peter John from more than one scrape
because he roomed with him."</p>

<p>"I haven't seen Peter John either for more than
a week."</p>

<p>"We ought to look him up and keep an eye on
him."</p>

<p>"'Keep an eye on him'? You want to keep both
eyes and your hands and your feet too, for the matter
of that. He certainly is the freshest specimen
I ever saw, and the worst of it all is that he doesn't
seem to know that he lacks anything. He's just
as confident when he marches up to Wagner and
gives him some points in running the track team as
he is when he's telling you and me how to work up
our Greek. And the fellow has flunked in Greek
every time he's been called up for the past ten
days."<a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a>"Yes, I know it. That's why I said we ought to
look out for him."</p>

<p>"He's got to learn how to look out for himself."</p>

<p>"He needs a tutor, though, Will&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Same as I do in my Greek? That's not nice of
you, Foster. It's bad enough to have to work up
the stuff without having it rubbed in. And yet,"
said Will quietly, "I suppose I am in the same box
with Peter John. He doesn't know some things and
I don't know others."</p>

<p>"No one has everything," said Foster quickly.</p>

<p>"Startling fact! But we fellows who live in glass
houses mustn't throw stones I 'fawncy,' as my
learned instructor would put it. There I am again,
finding fault even with Splinter when I ought to
be boning on this Greek to make up for my own
lacks. Here I go!" And Will resolutely turned to
the books which were lying open on his desk.</p>

<p>The silence that reigned in the room was broken
in a few minutes when Hawley opened the door and
entered. His coming was greeted enthusiastically,
and when he had accepted the invitation to be seated,
he said quickly, "I can't stay, fellows."</p>

<p>"You never can nowadays, Hawley. Since you've
been on the team you've shaken all your old friends."</p>

<p>"You'd shake too, if you had the captain over you
that we have."</p>

<p>"Is he hard?"</p>

<p>"Hard? He beats every coach we've got. He
goes into the game as if there wasn't anything else
to think of."</p>

<p>"It counts though," responded Will emphatically.
"We haven't lost but two games so far this season,
<a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a>and they were with &mdash;&mdash; and &mdash;&mdash;. Of course we
couldn't expect to win those."</p>

<p>"Oh, we've done fairly well. But the hardest rub
is coming next Saturday. That's when we're going
down to the city to have our game with Alden.
There'll be a big crowd out, and the Alden alumni
are mighty strong around town there too, and they'll
be out in bunches. We've got to keep up our end,
and that's why I've come over to see you fellows.
I want you both to go next Saturday."</p>

<p>"Sure!" shouted Will, leaping to his feet. "We'll
be on hand. You rest your soul easy about that."</p>

<p>"How many are going, Hawley?" inquired Foster
quietly.</p>

<p>"So far, about half the college have agreed to go.
We'd like to get another hundred to go along. It
will make a big difference to the team. Last year
there were six thousand people on the grounds, and
it rained hard too, all the time. This year, if we
have a good day, there'll be ten thousand on hand
anyway."</p>

<p>"How are the fellows going down?" said Foster.</p>

<p>"Chartered a special train."</p>

<p>"What's the fare?"</p>

<p>"About six dollars for the round trip."</p>

<p>"Come back the same day?"</p>

<p>"Can if you want to, the train is coming back that
night after the game. But a good many will stay
over till Monday."</p>

<p>"When do you have to know?"</p>

<p>"You ought to give in your names by to-morrow
night. Peter John is going along. I think he'll be
a good mascot, don't you?" laughed Hawley.<a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a>"I'm sorry Peter John is going," said Foster
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Sorry!" exclaimed Hawley aghast. "Why, man
alive, he'll have the time of his life."</p>

<p>"That's what I'm afraid of, and besides he ought
not to spend the money."</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about that," said Hawley
quickly. "But he may make enough on the game to
pay all his expenses."</p>

<p>"Has he staked money on the game?" said Will.</p>

<p>"You'll have to ask him," retorted Hawley somewhat
sharply. "We can count on you two fellows
then, can we?"</p>

<p>"That's what you can!" replied Will heartily.</p>

<p>"I'll think about it and let you know in the morning,"
said Foster. And Hawley at once departed
from the room.</p>

<p>"What do you suppose it means that Peter John
is going?" was Foster's first question after their
visitor had departed.</p>

<p>"I don't know, but I don't like the look of it,"
responded Will.</p>

<p>"Neither do I. Can we do anything to stop it?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm afraid not. Peter John is getting beyond
us."</p>

<p>Foster shook his head thoughtfully but made no
response, and the work was resumed. For an hour
each boy labored at his desk, and then Foster was
the first to break in upon the silence.</p>

<p>"Will," he said, "I think I'll go with you on that
trip with the team."</p>

<p>"I don't think I'll go," said Will quietly.<a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a>"Not go? Why not?" demanded Foster in astonishment.</p>

<p>"I've been thinking it over and I've made up my
mind that it won't do for me to break in on the
regular program I've mapped out for myself. You
see Saturday is the day when I always have a double
dose with my tutor, and it won't do for me to spoil
it," and Will Phelps made a wry face as he spoke.</p>

<p>"But, Will," protested Foster, "you can make up
the work before then and not lose a bit."</p>

<p>"Yes, I've thought of that, but I don't think I'll
do it. It's a bitter dose I know, but I might as well
swallow it first as last."</p>

<p>"Do you mean it?"</p>

<p>"Don't I act as if I did?"</p>

<p>"All right. I'll not say another word. Maybe
it'll be a way out for Peter John. I'd like to fix it
for the fellow if I can."</p>

<p>"I don't just see&mdash;" began Will; but he stopped
when he perceived that his room-mate had risen
from his seat and was about to depart from the room.</p>

<p>On the following day the excitement among the
students of Winthrop increased when a mass meeting
was held and various leading spirits of the
college delivered very florid and perfervid addresses
in which the student-body was urged to support
the team and take advantage of the low rates offered
to accompany it and be on hand on the field to cheer
it on to victory. Shouts and cheers greeted the
speakers, and when the meeting broke up and the
boys were returning to their rooms Mott and Peter
John joined Will on his way to Perry Hall.<a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a>"Have the time of your young life on Saturday,
Phelps," said Mott loudly.</p>

<p>"I'm not going."</p>

<p>"Why not? All the fellows are."</p>

<p>"I'd like to, but I've some work I <i>must</i> do, and I
can't break in on it."</p>

<p>"You must be a 'shark' Phelps," laughed Mott.
"I'd like to see the work that would keep me away.
Peter John Schenck and I intend to take it all in,
don't we, freshman?" he added, turning to his companion
as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Ye-es, I guess so," responded that worthy who
had been addressed.</p>

<p>"You'll have a good time," said Will. "I wish I
could go too, but I can't, and the only thing for me
to do is to stand up and not whine over it."</p>

<p>"You'll be sorry for it," laughed Mott, as he and
Peter John turned toward the latter's room. "All
we can do will be to try to make up for what you're
going to lose."</p>

<p>And Will Phelps did almost feel that he was too
strict in his demands upon himself when the student-body
formed in line early Saturday morning
and, preceded by a band, started down the
street on the way to the station. His room-mate
had said no more to him concerning the trip, but as
Will marched by Foster's side he could feel the deep
sympathy of his friend. His heart almost misgave
him. It was not too late even yet to go, for doubtless
he could borrow money of some one. Perhaps
it was too much a mere sentiment to hold himself
to his work as he was doing. And he detested the
work so heartily too.<a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a>Still he held rigidly to his decision, and even when
the heavily laden train pulled out from the station
and the words of the song which was sung came back
to him he did not falter, though his heart was heavy
within him.</p>

<h4>TELEGRAMS</h4>


<p>When Will Phelps returned to the college, the
entire place to him seemed to be deserted, and a
stillness rested over all that was almost oppressive.
Even the few college boys who were to be seen about
the grounds all shared in the prevailing gloom and
increased the sense of loneliness in the heart of the
young freshman. When he entered his room, the
sight of his room-mate's belongings was almost like
that of the possessions of the dead and Will Phelps
was utterly miserable and dejected.</p>

<p>Work he decided was his only cure and at once
he busied himself at his task from which he was
aroused in the course of an hour or two by the
coming of the senior who was tutoring him.</p>

<p>"I'm mighty glad to see you," said Will impulsively.
"I feel as if I was about the only one of my
kind in the world."</p>

<p>"You're downhearted over deciding to stay in town,
to-day?" replied his tutor pleasantly. "Oh, well,
never mind. It will be a good tonic for you and when
you've passed your mid-year's in Greek, you'll never
once think of this trip with the team to-day."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid that's cold comfort just at the present
moment. I've just been hanging on and that's all
there is to it."</p>

<p>"Sometimes it's the only thing a fellow can do.
It may bring a lot of other good things with it,
though."</p>

<p>"Maybe," replied Will dubiously. "There's one
<a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a>thing I've learned though, and if I ever come to know
my Greek as well as I know that, I'll pass all right."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"Never to get behind. I'll keep up and not catch
up. When I see what a fool I made of myself in my
'prep' days, I wonder sometimes that I ever got into
college anyway. I never really worked any except
in a part of the last year."</p>

<p>"You're working now," suggested the senior.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have to. I don't like it though. The
descent to Avernus is the easy trip, if I remember
my Virgil correctly. It's the getting back that's
hard."</p>

<p>"Do you know, I never just believed that."</p>

<p>"You didn't? Why not? Why, you can see it
every day! It's just as easy as sliding down hill.
It's dragging the sled back up the hill that makes the
trouble."</p>

<p>"That isn't quite a fair illustration. If I'm not
mistaken, it seems to me that somewhere, sometime,
some one said that 'The way of the transgressor is
hard.' He didn't seem to agree with Virgil's statement
somehow, did he?"</p>

<p>"But that means it's hard afterward."</p>

<p>"That isn't what it says. I think it means just
what it says too."</p>

<p>"I don't see."</p>

<p>"Well, to me it's like this. In every fellow there's
a good side and a bad side. Sort of a Doctor Jekyl
and Mr. Hyde in every one of us. I heard the other
day in our laboratory of a man who had taken and
grafted one part of the body of an insect on the body
<a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a>of another. He tried it both on the chrysalis and on
an insect too. I understood that he took the pupa
of a spider and by very careful work grafted upon
it the pupa of a fly. Think of what that monstrosity
must have been when it passed out from the chrysalis
and became a full-fledged living being. One part
of it trying to get away from the other. One wanting
to fly and the other to hide. One part wanting
to feed on flies and the other part in mortal terror
of all spiders."</p>

<p>"Was that really so?" inquired Will deeply interested.</p>

<p>"I didn't see it myself, but it was told over in the
biological laboratory and I don't think there was
any question about it. It struck me that it was
just the way some of us seem to be built, a sort of
a spider and fly combination and not the ordinary
combination either, when the fly is usually inside
of the spider and very soon a part of his majesty.
And yet when you've told all that you know, it's a
sort of monstrosity after all, and that the truth
is that a fellow really <i>is</i> his best self if he'll only
give that part half a chance. That's why I say the
way of the transgressor is hard and not easy. A
fellow is going against the grain of his best side.
He throws away his best chances under protest all
the while, and <i>he</i> doesn't want to do it either. No,
Phelps, I believe if a fellow goes down hill it's like
a man dragging a balky horse. It looks easy but it
isn't, and he himself is pulling against it all the
time."</p>

<p>"I never thought of it in that way before."</p>

<p>"Then on the other hand this very kind of work
<a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a>you're doing now is the sort that stirs your blood.
I expect that those fellows who live down in the
tropics and about all the work they have to do to
feed themselves is to pick a banana off a tree and
go through the exertion of peeling it, don't really
get half the fun out of life that some of us boys
had up on the hillside farms in Vermont. Why,
when we'd have to get up winter mornings, with
the weather so cold that we'd have to be all the
while on the lookout that we didn't freeze our ears
or noses, and when we'd have to shovel out the paths
through three feet of snow and cut the wood and
carry water to the stock, it did seem at times to be
a trifle strenuous; but really I think the boys in
Vermont get more fun out of life than the poor
chaps in the tropics do who plow their fields by just
jabbing a hole in the ground with their heel, and
when they plant, all they have to do is to just stick
a slip in the ground. It's the same way here, Phelps.
This sort of thing you're doing is hard, no doubt
about that; but it's the sort of thing that really stirs
up a live man, after all."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I'll be all stirred up if we don't get
at this work pretty soon," laughed Will, who was
nevertheless deeply impressed by the words he had
heard from the prospective valedictorian of the
senior class. "Why can't we do it all up this morning?"
he inquired eagerly.</p>

<p>"All?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I mean all we were planning to do to-day. I'd
like to go down to the gym this afternoon and watch
the bulletins of the game. I decided not to go, but
if I can get my work off that'll be the next best
<a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a>thing; and besides it'll help to pass the time. It's
going to be a long day for me."</p>

<p>"All right, I'm agreeable," replied the senior cordially.</p>

<p>Until the hour of noon was rung out by the clock
in the tower, Will labored hard. The words of his
tutor had been inspiring, but he could not disguise
from himself the fact, however, that he had little
love for the task. It was simply a determination
not to be "downed," as Will expressed it, that led
him on and he was holding on doggedly, resolutely,
almost blindly, but still he was holding on. About
three o'clock in the afternoon the few students who
were in town assembled at the telegraph office
where messages were to be received from the team
at intervals of ten minutes describing the progress
of the game. One of the seniors had been selected
to read the dispatches and only a few minutes had
elapsed after the assembly had gathered before the
senior appeared, coming out of the telegraph office
and waving aloft the yellow slip. A cheer greeted
his appearance but this was followed by a tense
silence as he read aloud:</p>

<p>"They're off. Great crowd. Winthrop line outweighed
ten pounds to a man. Holding like a stone
wall."</p>

<p>"That's the way to talk it!" shouted the reader as
he handed the dispatch to the operator, and then
began to sing one of the college songs, in which he
was speedily joined by the noisy group.</p>

<p>The song was hushed when again the operator
appeared and handed another slip to the leader.
Glancing quickly at it the senior read aloud:<a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a>"Ball on Alden's twenty-five yard line. Great run
by Thomas. Hawley playing star game."</p>

<p>Hawley, Thomas, and the captain of the team, and
then the team itself, were cheered, and once more
the group of students gave vent to their feelings in
a noisy song. It was all stimulating and interesting,
and Will Phelps was so keenly alive to all that
was occurring, that for the time even his disappointment
in not being able to accompany the team was
forgotten.</p>

<p>A groan followed the reading of the next dispatch.
"Alden's ball on a fumble. Steadily forcing Winthrop
line back by superior weight. Ball on Winthrop's
forty-yard line."</p>

<p>"That looks bad," said Will's tutor, who had now
joined the assembly and was standing beside Will
Phelps. "We've a quick team, but I'm afraid of
Alden's weight. They've two or three men who
ought not to be permitted to play, anyway."</p>

<p>"Professionals?" inquired Will.</p>

<p>"Yes, or worse."</p>

<p>"Have we any on our team?"</p>

<p>"Hardly," laughed the senior. But Will was thinking
of the conversation he had had with Hawley
when they had first entered college, and was silent.
Besides, another dispatch was about to be read
and he was eager to hear.</p>

<p>"Ball on Winthrop's five-yard line. Hawley injured
and out of the game."</p>

<p>"Too much beef," muttered the reader disconsolately,
and the silence in the assembly was eloquent
of feelings that could not be expressed.</p>

<p>Less than the regular interval had elapsed when
<a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a>another yellow slip was handed to the reader, and
the suspense in the crowd was almost painful. The
very silence and the glances that were given were
all indicative of the fear that now possessed every
heart.</p>

<p>"Alden makes touchdown. No goal," read the
leader.</p>

<p>"Six nothing! Team's no good this year, anyway!"
declared one of the students angrily. "Had
no business to play Alden, anyway! Ought to
have games with teams in our class."</p>

<p>"Alden seemed to be in our class last year, or
rather she didn't," said the reader quietly. "Remember
what the score was?"</p>

<p>"No. What was it?"</p>

<p>"Twenty-four to nothing in our favor. If they
win this year it will be only following out the regulation
see-saw that's been going on for seven years.
Neither college has won its game for two successive
years."</p>

<p>"Alden will win this time all right enough."</p>

<p>"Perhaps. The game isn't ended yet. You haven't
learned the Winthrop spirit yet, which is never to
give up till the game is played clear through to the
end. You've got something to learn yet." The
rebuked student did not reply, but the expression
upon his face betrayed the fact that he was still
unconvinced, and that he did indeed have the first
of all lessons taught at Winthrop yet to learn.</p>

<p>The score was unchanged at the end of the first
half, and the students scattered during the period of
intermission, assured that no further information
would be received until after the second half of the
<a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a>game was begun. The confidence in victory was,
however, not so great when they assembled once
more, though the interest apparently was as keen
as at the beginning. For some unaccountable reason
the dispatches were delayed and a much longer
interval than usual intervened before the welcome
yellow slip was handed to the announcer. Murmurs
of disappointment were heard on every side, and it
became more evident with every passing moment
that hope had mostly been lost. At last, however,
the welcome word was received, and even Will Phelps
was so eager to hear that he crowded forward into
the front ranks of the assembly.</p>

<p>"Alden scores touchdown and goal. Winthrop
fighting desperately, but outweighed and outplayed
since Hawley taken out."</p>

<p>"It's all over but the shouting," said the sophomore
whose gloomy views had been so sharply rebuked
by the senior. "There isn't any use in hanging
around here. Come on, fellows! Let's go
where there's something a little more cheerful."</p>

<p>He made as if to depart from the crowd, but as
no one followed him, he apparently abandoned his
purpose and remained with his fellows. Only two
more dispatches were read, the second of which
announced the end of the game with the score still
standing in favor of Alden thirteen to nothing.</p>

<p>"Rotten!" exclaimed the sophomore angrily. "Just
what we might&mdash;" He stopped abruptly as the
senior advanced to a place where he could be seen
by all and began to harangue the assembly.</p>

<p>"Now, fellows," he began, "the best test of our
spirit is that we can stand up and take this in the
<a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a>right way. Of course, we wanted the game, and
some of us hoped and expected we would have it too.
But the other team, and doubtless the better one, has
won. Next year we'll be ready for them again, or
rather you will, for I sha'n't be here, and the time
to begin to win then is right here and now. But I
want to put in a good word for our team. I haven't
a doubt that they did their level best, and if we
could see them now, we'd be almost as proud of
them as if they had won. I know every man put
in his best work. And what I propose is that we
go down to the station to-night and meet them with
as hearty a cheer as if they had won the game, for
we know they did their best to uphold the honor of
old Winthrop to a man!"</p>

<p>A cheer greeted the senior's words, and at ten
o'clock that evening all the students who were in
town assembled at the little station to greet the returning
members of the team. But Will Phelps,
when the train came to a standstill and the boys
leaped out upon the platform, speedily forgot all
about the game in the sight which greeted his eyes.</p>

<h4>PETER JOHN'S DOWNFALL</h4>


<p>In the midst of the cheering and shouting that
greeted the return of the team and its supporters,
Will Phelps attained a glimpse of the sturdy heroes
themselves who had fought the battle of the gridiron.
Some of them were somewhat battered and
he could see that Hawley carried his arm in a sling.
His classmate's face was pale, but as he was surrounded
by a crowd of students, Will found it was
impossible to make his way to him and soon gave up
the attempt. He was standing somewhat back from
the train eagerly watching all that was going on
about him, but only in a half-hearted way joining
in the excitement, for the defeat of the team and
his own disappointment in not being able to make
the trip had chilled his enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Suddenly he caught sight of Foster as he stepped
down upon the platform and instantly Will began
to push his way forward to greet him. As Foster
stepped down he turned back as if to assist some
one, and Will perceived that it was Peter John
Schenck who was being assisted. But his actions
were strange and his general appearance was woebegone
in the extreme.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with Peter John? Sick?"
inquired Will as he pressed forward.</p>

<p>"Sick? Sick nothing!" retorted Foster in a low
voice. "Can't you see what ails him? The fool!"</p>

<p>The maudlin expression on Peter John's face, his
wabbling steps, the silly smile with which he greeted<a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a>
Will at once disclosed what his condition was and
with a feeling of disgust Will turned away.</p>

<p>"Hold on, Will," called Peter John tremulously,
beginning to cry as he spoke, "don't go backsh on a
fellow now. I los' all my money. Seven dollar I
put up on the team an' they jis' sold out," and Peter
John's tears increased and he threatened to fall on
Foster's shoulder.</p>

<p>Will had turned back sharply at the words, his disgust
and anger so plainly stamped upon his face that
even Peter John was moved by it and began to sob
audibly. "Sold out, Will! Seven dollar all gone!
Too bad! Too bad!"</p>

<p>"Get a taxi, Will," said Foster in a low voice.
"If we can get the fellow up to his room without attracting
too much attention we may be able to put
him in bed."</p>

<p>As Will turned away, he was rejoiced to notice
that his classmate's condition had apparently not attracted
the attention of the crowd, which was too
much occupied in the excitement of greeting the
team to be mindful of other matters. Disgust and
anger were so mingled in Will's feelings that he was
hardly aware of what he was doing, but at last he
succeeded in getting a taxi, and bidding the
driver hold it near the end of the platform, he hastened
back to the assistance of Foster.</p>

<p>As he returned he noticed that Mott was now with
Peter John, and only one glance was required to show
that he was in a condition similar to that of Peter
John, though not quite so helpless.</p>

<p>"Glad t' see you, freshman," stammered Mott as<a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a>
Will approached. "Great sport, that fellow," and
he pointed stupidly at Peter John as he spoke. "Put
up his monish like li'le man. No squeal from him,
no, not a squeal. No, goo' man. Goo' man, freshman."</p>

<p>"Shall we take him too?" inquired Will of Foster.</p>

<p>"Yes, if there's room."</p>

<p>"I think there will be."</p>

<p>"He can make his way all right, I think, but you'll
have to help me with Peter John. Get hold of his
other arm. That's right," he added as Will grasped
his maudlin classmate by the left arm, while Foster
supported him by the right.</p>

<p>"Come on, Mott, if you want to ride up," said Will
sharply to the sophomore.</p>

<p>"That ish good o' you, freshman," drawled Mott.
"Broke, dead broke! Do ash much for you some
day. You get broke some daysh, I s'pose."</p>

<p>"Shut up, Mott," said Foster savagely.</p>

<p>"A'-a' right. Just's you say, not's I care."</p>

<p>A few in the assemblage noted the condition of the
boys and laughed thoughtlessly, but neither Will nor
his room-mate was in a frame of mind to respond.
Disgusted, angry, mortified beyond expression, they
nevertheless assisted the boys to the seats in the
taxi which Will had secured, and quickly doing as
he was bidden, the driver started rapidly up the
street. Peter John had fallen heavily against Will's
shoulder and was instantly asleep, but Mott was
not to be so easily disposed of. Peering out from
the window at the crowds that were moving up
the street and by which the taxi was passing, he
<a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a>emitted three or four wild whoops and then began to
sing:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"We're coming, we're coming, our brave little band,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the right side of temperance we always do stand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We don't use tobacco, for this we do think,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That those who do use it most always do drink."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Mott, if you don't keep quiet I'll throw you out,"
exclaimed Will mortified as he perceived that the
passing crowd was turning about to discover what
the noisy commotion meant.</p>

<p>"A'-a' right," responded Mott in a shout that
could have been heard far away. "I'll be as sthill as
an intensified hippopotamus! Not a sound of my
voice shall awake the echoes of these purple hills.
I'll not be the one to arouse the slumbers of this
peaceful vale."</p>

<p>"Driver," interrupted Will sharply, "stop your
cab."</p>

<p>"No, no, Will, you'll only make a bad matter worse.
Let's keep on and do the best we can. It'll only call
attention to ourselves," said Foster hastily.</p>

<p>"Thatsh sho," assented Mott noisily, swaying in
his seat as he spoke. "Keep on, driver. Go straight
up to prexy's house; I've got something p'ticular to
shay t' him. Shame, way the team sold out t'-day!
Disgrace to old Winthrop! Have a good mind to
leave the college myself an' go to Alden; they're men
there! They know how to stan' up an' take their
med'cine. Great place, Alden! Guess they'll be
shorry here when they shee me with a great big A
on my sweater!"<a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a>"Mott, keep still," exclaimed Foster.</p>

<p>"Keep still yerself, freshman. Don't talk t' me."</p>

<p>There was nothing to be done except to endure it
all in silence or put the noisy student out of the
taxi. Poor Will felt that the people they were passing
looked upon all four of the occupants of the cab
as if they were all in the same disgraceful condition.
His eyes blazed and his cheeks were crimson. To
him it seemed as if the cab was scarcely moving
on its way to Leland Hall. The way was
interminable, the suffering almost too great to be
endured.</p>

<p>At last, however, the driver stopped before the
dormitory where Mott had his room and Foster
said, "Will, I'll look after this fellow if you'll attend
to Peter John."</p>

<p>"Nobody&mdash;no freshman in p'ticular&mdash;ish going to
help me!" exclaimed Mott noisily. "I can walk a
chalk line, I can. Keep your eyes on me and you'll
see how it's done."</p>

<p>"All right. Get out, then," said Foster hastily.</p>

<p>Mott lurched out of the cab, and the driver, at
Foster's word, at once started on and neither of the
boys glanced behind to see how it fared with the intoxicated
sophomore. They were eager now to dispose
of their classmate, and as soon as the taxi
halted in front of Leland Hall they tried to arouse
the slumbering freshman. At last, by dint of their
united efforts, they succeeded in lifting him to the
ground, and then they somehow got him up the stairway
and soon had him in his bed. When their labors
were ended Will exclaimed, "It must be midnight.
Surely the people couldn't see who we were except
<a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a>when the cab passed the street lights, but I'm
afraid some of them knew then."</p>

<p>"That isn't so bad. I don't care half so much
about their seeing as I do about something else."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"What they saw. Poor fool!" he added bitterly
as he turned and glanced at the bed whereon Peter
John was lying and noisily sleeping. "I did my best
to hold him back, but he would go on with Mott."</p>

<p>"Do you think he lost his money too?"</p>

<p>"Haven't a doubt of it."</p>

<p>"And he didn't have very much to lose."</p>

<p>"It was all he had. It would have been the same
if it had been seven thousand instead of just plain
seven. He was so set up by the attentions of Mott
that he was an easy mark. I never saw anything
like it."</p>

<p>"Well, all I can say is that I hope I sha'n't again,
but probably I shall if he stays in college," said Will
bitterly.</p>

<p>"It's in him, that's about all one can say," said
Foster. "If it hadn't been here it would have been
somewhere else. And yet they say that a college is a
dangerous place for a young fellow to be in."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it."</p>

<p>"No more do I. There are all kinds here the same
as there are pretty much everywhere, and all there is
of it is that a fellow has a little more freedom to follow
out just what he wants to do."</p>

<p>"Come on," suggested Will, starting toward the
door. "We can't do anything more for Peter John.
He'll probably be around to see us to-morrow."</p>

<p>As the boys approached the doorway they met<a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a>
Hawley and at his urgent request turned back into
the room with him. The big freshman glanced at
his sleeping room-mate and then laughed as he said,
"Too young. Ought not to have left his mother
yet." As neither of the boys replied, Hawley continued,
"He'll have to quit that or he'll queer himself
in the college. I don't know that he can do that any
more successfully than he has done already though,"
he added.</p>

<p>Will was irritated that Hawley should take the
matter in such a light way and said half-angrily,
"Do you suppose he'll be hauled up before the
faculty?"</p>

<p>"Not unless they hear of it," laughed Hawley,
"and I don't believe they will."</p>

<p>"Tell us about the game," interrupted Foster.</p>

<p>"My story is short and not very sweet," retorted
Hawley grimly, glancing at his arm as he spoke.</p>

<p>"How did that happen?"</p>

<p>"Nobody knows. It's done and that's all there is
to it. I'm out of the game for the rest of this season."</p>

<p>"That's too bad. Did Alden really have such a
tremendous team?"</p>

<p>"Look at the score. You know what that was,
don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I heard. Come on, Will. We'd better be
in bed. We'll get Hawley to tell us all about the
game some other time. Come on."</p>

<p>The two freshmen at once departed, but when they
were in their own room it was not the lost game
which was uppermost in their minds and conversation,
but the fall of Peter John. And when at last
<a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a>they sought their beds it was with the conviction that
Peter John himself would seek them out within a day
or two and try to explain how it was that his downfall
had occurred. This, they thought, would give
them the opportunity they desired, and if the faculty
did not discover the matter and take action of their
own then they might be able to say or do something
to recall Peter John to himself.</p>

<p>On the following day, however, their classmate did
not appear, and in the days that followed he did not
once come to their room. Mott they had seen, but
he had only laughed lightly when he met them and
made no reference to the ride he had taken in their
taxi.</p>

<p>"I don't believe Peter John knows that we know
anything about what happened on his trip," said Foster
thoughtfully one day.</p>

<p>"What makes him keep away from us all the time,
then?"</p>

<p>"That's so. Probably his conscience isn't in the
best of condition. You don't suppose he's waiting
for us to make the first move, do you?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"I hate to leave the fellow to himself," said Foster.
"He'll go to the dogs as sure as you're born if he is."</p>

<p>"If he isn't there already."</p>

<p>"Well, if he's there we must help to get him out."</p>

<p>"You're the one to do it, Foster. You aren't working
up your Greek."</p>

<p>Will had been working with even greater intensity
than before and was beginning to see the results of
his labors. With his disposition there was no comparative
degree. Everything was at one extreme or
<a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a>the other and now he was giving himself but little
rest and even Peter John's disgrace was not so keenly
felt by him as at the time when it had occurred.</p>

<p>"I think I'll have to do something," assented Foster,
"or at least try to."</p>

<p>But on the following day an excitement broke out
among the students at Winthrop that speedily and
completely banished from the minds of Will and Foster
even their well-intended efforts to aid their weak
and misguided classmate.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h3>

<h4>AN ALARMING REPORT</h4>


<p>The excitement first came to Will Phelps when one
night he was returning to his room from his dinner
in the fraternity house. The house, together with
four or five other similar houses, was situated in the
same street with the dormitory, but was distant a
walk of seven or eight minutes, and there was usually
a crowd of the college boys to be seen on the
village street three times a day when they passed
to or from their boarding places.</p>

<p>On this particular evening Will chanced to be
alone, and as he went on he perceived Mott approaching.
He had had but little to say to the fellow since
the escapade, and now as he recognized the sophomore
his feeling of anger or disgust arose once more,
and he was inclined to pass him with only a light
nod of recognition.</p>

<p>But Mott was not to be so lightly turned aside or
ignored, and as he saw Will he stopped, and his manner
at once betrayed the excitement under which he
was laboring.</p>

<p>"Have you heard the news, Phelps?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I haven't heard anything," replied Will coldly.</p>

<p>"You haven't? Well, you ought to. It's all over
college now."</p>

<p>"What's all over college?"</p>

<p>"Why, the report of the typhoid."</p>

<p>"What?" demanded Will, instantly aroused.</p>

<p>"I mean what I say. And there are all sorts of
reports about what's to be done. Some say the fac<a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a>ulty
have decided to shut up shop for a few weeks,
and some say they've sent for experts, and I don't
know what all."</p>

<p>"Who are the fellows that are down with it?"</p>

<p>"Schenck&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Peter John?" demanded Will sharply.</p>

<p>"Yes, and there are seven others. He's the only
freshman; there are two sophs, two juniors, and one
senior. Wagner is the senior."</p>

<p>"Where are they?"</p>

<p>"They're all in the infirmary, and the whole shop
has been quarantined."</p>

<p>"When was it found out?"</p>

<p>"Only to-day, this afternoon, I think. You see all
eight have been under the weather for a while, and
the doctor here thought it was first one thing that
ailed them and then another. Last night or this
morning they had a consultation, and decided that
every one of the eight had typhoid fever. It's a
great go, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"And you say Peter John is one?"</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>"Is he in the infirmary?"</p>

<p>"Yes, every one of them is there."</p>

<p>"Is he very much sick?"</p>

<p>"Can't tell yet, but he's sick enough."</p>

<p>"Can anybody see him?" inquired Will thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"No. There isn't any one allowed in the building
except the nurses, doctors, and the families of the
fellows, that is, when they come. I understand that
word has been sent to all the families, and nurses
<a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a>have already been engaged, and that some of them
are on the ground now."</p>

<p>"It's terrible!" said Will with a shudder.</p>

<p>"I know what I'm going to do," said Mott glibly.</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"I'm going home. Of course, the governor won't
believe me at first when I tell him why I've returned
to the ancestral abode, but you may rest easy when
he sees it in the papers, then he'll believe it all right
enough. Fine to have your daddy believe a lying
newspaper before he takes the word of his own offspring,
isn't it?"</p>

<p>"May not be all his fault."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is. I'd have been as decent a fellow as
you or any fellow in college if I'd been treated halfway
decently. But I wasn't."</p>

<p>Will had his own ideas as to that, but he did not
express them, for the full sense of the calamity of the
college was now strongly upon him. Even the shadows
of the great hills seemed to him to be more
sombre than usual, and in whichever direction he
looked there was an outer gloom corresponding to
the one within. In the first shock of the report a
nameless fear swept over him, and already he was
positive that in his own case he could discover certain
symptoms that were the forerunners of the
dreaded disease. He hastily bade Mott good-night
and ran all the way back to his room.</p>

<p>Foster was already there, and at once he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Foster, have you heard about it?"</p>

<p>"The typhoid?"<a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a>"Yes. They say Peter John and Wagner and six
others are down with it."</p>

<p>"It's true."</p>

<p>"What's going to be done?"</p>

<p>"You mean what the college is going to do or what
we're to do?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's it. Both."</p>

<p>"I've telephoned home," said Foster quietly.</p>

<p>"You have?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I have just come back from the office."</p>

<p>"Did you telephone my father?"</p>

<p>"No. I telephoned my father and told him to ring
up your house."</p>

<p>"And did he?"</p>

<p>"Of course he did."</p>

<p>"Did you hear anything&mdash;I mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now, look here, Will," said Foster quietly.
"Don't get rattled. I know it's bad, but there isn't
any use in losing your head over it. I've been down
to see the dean and have talked it over with him."</p>

<p>"What did he have to say?"</p>

<p>"He said the report was true and the eight fellows
were all down with the typhoid, and that every one of
them had been taken to the infirmary."</p>

<p>"What else?" demanded Will, his excitement increasing
in spite of his effort to be calm.</p>

<p>"That's what I'm trying to tell you, if you'll give
me half a chance. He said the president had sent
for the best experts in the country, and that everything
that it was possible to do would be done. He
said too, that they would deal absolutely squarely
with the boys, and if it was discovered that there was
the least danger of it spreading they would tell us,
<a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a>and if necessary they'd close for a while till the whole
thing had been ferreted out."</p>

<p>"That's square."</p>

<p>"Of course it is."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do, Foster?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, that is, for a day or two anyway. I've
told my father, and if he thinks I'd better come
home he'll say so."</p>

<p>"But he may not know."</p>

<p>"He will in a day or two."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do now?"</p>

<p>"Study my Greek."</p>

<p>"I ought to, but I'm going out for a little while.
I've got to cool off a bit before I can settle down to
work."</p>

<p>"Don't be gone long. You'll only see the fellows
and get stirred up all the more. I'd drop it and go
to 'boning.' It's the best cure."</p>

<p>"It is for a fellow like you, Foster. I can't do it
yet. I've got to get outdoors till I can get my breath
again."</p>

<p>Seizing his cap Will went out into the night. He
passed by Leland Hall and glancing up discovered
that there was a light in Peter John's room. Instantly
he entered the building and bounding up the
stairway knocked on his classmate's door, and in response
to the invitation entered and found Hawley
within and alone.</p>

<p>"Hello, Hawley. What's the news about Peter
John?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he's got it. Temperature a hundred and four
and a half and all that sort of thing."</p>

<p>"Any idea where or how he got it?"<a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a>"Not the least."</p>

<p>"Have you seen him?"</p>

<p>"Since he went to the infirmary? Yes, once; but
I sha'n't see him again till he comes out well or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is he the worst?"</p>

<p>"No. Wagner seems to be the hardest hit, but
they told me you couldn't tell very much about it yet.
Have to wait a few days anyway."</p>

<p>"Mott says he is going home."</p>

<p>"Yes, there probably will be a lot of the fellows
leaving by to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Are you afraid?"</p>

<p>"Some."</p>

<p>"Going to leave?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to wait a day or two and see what turns
up before I decide just what I shall do."</p>

<p>On his way back to his room Will fell in with several
others of his classmates, and the exciting conversation
was repeated in each case until at last when
he joined Foster, whom he found still poring over his
lesson in Greek for the morrow, his feelings were so
overwrought that he was almost beside himself.</p>

<p>"Everybody's going to leave, Foster," he declared.</p>

<p>"Not quite, for I'm not going yet myself."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" Will ceased abruptly as he perceived
that a messenger boy was standing in front of his
door. Quickly seizing the envelope he perceived that
it was directed to himself and instantly tearing it
open he read:</p>

<p>"If new cases develop within three days come
home. Otherwise remain. Wire me daily." The
message was signed by his father.</p>

<p>"That settles it!" exclaimed Will, "I'm going to
<a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a>bed. Splinter will be easy on us to-morrow anyway."</p>

<p>Foster smiled as he shook his head and continued
his own work, but his room-mate was not aware of
either action.</p>

<p>In chapel on the following morning the president
of the college reiterated the statement which the
dean already had made to Foster, and after trying
to show the students that a panic was even more to
be feared than the fever, and promising to keep them
fully and frankly informed as to the exact status of
affairs, he dismissed them to their recitations, which
it was understood were to be continued without interruption,
at least for the present.</p>

<p>In his Greek that day Will failed miserably and
completely, and his anger at Splinter was intensified
when the professor near the close of the recitation
said:</p>

<p>"It is quite needless, I fawncy, for me to emphasize,
young gentlemen, the necessity there is at the
present time for you all to adopt the utmost care in
all matters pertaining especially to your health. I
refer to you individually as well as collectively. My
advice to you is to use only mineral water&mdash;I refer
obviously to the water you drink&mdash;and it might be
well to avoid the undue use of milk&mdash;"</p>

<p>A shout of laughter interrupted the professor
which caused his face to flush with anger and he
arose abruptly from his seat, the signal that the
class was dismissed.</p>

<p>As Will, who was among the last to pass out, came
near the desk the professor said to him, "Mr. Phelps,
I should be pleased if you would remain for a brief
<a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a>time. I should like exceedingly to have a word with
you."</p>

<p>Accordingly, Will stood by the desk till all the class
had passed out, and then the professor said, "Ah,
Mr. Phelps, would you kindly inform me what your
opinion is as to the cause of the students receiving
my remarks a few minutes ago with such an outburst
of laughter? I assure you I had not the least
intention to say anything that should even appear to
be liable to excite the mirth of the young gentlemen.
I do not know that I was ever more serious in my
entire life."</p>

<p>"I think, professor, it was your reference to milk."</p>

<p>"Why should I not refer to it? In times of fear,
when typhoid fever is&mdash;is&mdash;ah, at least somewhat
feared, it is wise to be extremely cautious, and I
have it on the authority of men of the highest reputation
that milk is a medium through which the
germs of the disease transmit themselves most
readily."</p>

<p>"Yes, but you know, professor, the college is supposed
to think the freshmen feed on milk. That's
supposed to be their diet."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," replied the professor, smiling in a manner
that proclaimed his entire inability to perceive
the point. "That must be the point of the joke. Ah,
yes. I see it distinctly now. It is very good! It is
very good, indeed!"</p>

<p>"Professor, can you tell me my marks? How am I
doing in my Greek lately?"</p>

<p>"I am not supposed to reply to such a question
from any of the young gentlemen, but I fawncy in a
general way I may be able to respond to your query.<a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a>
Ah, yes," he added, glancing at the page in the little
book before him wherein Will's record was contained,
"there is an improvement, not great, it is true, but
still an improvement; and if your work continues it
will bring you almost up to the mark required."</p>

<p>"Almost?" exclaimed Will aghast. "You don't
mean to say, do you, Mr. Splinter&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. <i>who?</i>" demanded the professor, instantly
rising and his face flushing again with anger.</p>

<h4>A RARE INTERVIEW</h4>


<p>Instantly Will Phelps was overwhelmed with confusion.
His face flushed crimson and his knees
shook under the excitement which quickly seized
upon him. The opprobrious title by which the Greek
professor was known among the students and by
which he was commonly spoken of by them had slipped
from his tongue almost unconsciously. He
stood staring stupidly into the professor's face, while
visions of expulsion and future difficulty flashed into
his troubled mind.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, professor," he managed to
ejaculate at last. "I did not mean to say that. The
word slipped out before I knew it. I am very sorry
for it, for I certainly did not intend to be disrespectful
in any way."</p>

<p>"You insulted me!" exclaimed the professor in a
rage that under other circumstances would have
seemed almost ludicrous to Will. It was like the
anger of an infuriated canary bird or of some little
child.</p>

<p>"Then I want to apologize," said Will quietly.
"As I said, I certainly did not intend to do anything
of the kind."</p>

<p>"But you did," persisted the outraged teacher.
"You most assuredly did."</p>

<p>"Can't you believe me when I say it was not intentional?"</p>

<p>"That does not excuse it, but I fawncy the tendency
among the young gentlemen of the college is to
<a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a>bestow appellations upon the various members of
the faculty that are not warranted."</p>

<p>"I have heard some of them spoken of in that way,
but I don't think the fellows meant either to be disrespectful
or unkind," said Will eagerly.</p>

<p>"No, I fawncy it may in part be due to the thoughtlessness
of youth and I would not be unduly harsh
with you after your ample apology. Then you have
been accustomed to hear me myself referred to as
Splinter, have you?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;yes&mdash;that is&mdash;" stammered Will.</p>

<p>"Precisely. Now what in your opinion is the
basis upon which the students have added such a
derisive epithet to my name?"</p>

<p>Will was silent, though in spite of his efforts the
expression of his face betrayed somewhat the feeling
of blank amazement which possessed him.</p>

<p>"I fawncy I can trace its derivation," said the
professor simply. "Doubtless when I first became a
member of the faculty the appellation, or, let me see,
is it an appellation or a cognomen, as you commonly
have heard it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Will managed to respond.</p>

<p>"It is, then, as I fawncied, and doubtless was bestowed
upon me as indicative of my lack of avoirdupois.
And it was not entirely unnatural that they
should do so, for at the time when I came to Winthrop
I was very slight, very slight indeed. The
appellation, or cognomen, was without doubt given
in recognition of that fact, a custom not unknown,
among the classical nations and one prevalent among
the Hebrews and even among the Indians of America.
The history of names would provide an exceed<a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a>ingly
interesting field of study for you, Mr. Phelps."</p>

<p>Will bowed but did not speak, for he was afraid
to interrupt or to divert the childlike man from the
channel in which his thoughts appeared to be running.</p>

<p>"Such a name once given," resumed the professor,
"would doubtless cling to one long after physical
changes had been made that would no longer afford
an accurate basis for the nomenclature. But I was
very slight, very slight indeed, Mr. Phelps, when I
first came here some seventeen years ago, or, to be
exact, seventeen years and four months, that is,
four months lacking a few days. Why, I believe I
weighed only one hundred and seventeen pounds at
the time."</p>

<p>Will strove to be duly impressed by the fact, but
as he looked at the man who was somewhat above
six feet in height and whose body did not give many
tokens of having increased materially in breadth or
thickness since the time to which the professor referred,
he found it extremely difficult to repress the
smile that rose to his lips.</p>

<p>"Yes," resumed the professor quickly, "I have
increased in weight since that time but the appellation
still clings and doubtless will as long as I remain
in Winthrop."</p>

<p>"How much do you weigh now, professor?" The
moment Will asked the question he regretted it, but
the temptation was too strong to be resisted.</p>

<p>"I cannot say exactly," said the professor in some
confusion, "but my weight has very materially
increased. If I recall aright, the last time when I
was weighed I had added two and three-quarters
<a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a>pounds. It is true it was in the winter and doubtless
heavier clothing may have slightly modified the
result. But still I can safely affirm that I am much
heavier than I was at the time when I joined the
Winthrop faculty."</p>

<p>"Do you find that you feel better now that you
are more corpulent? I have heard it said that addition
to the body is subtraction from the brain. Do
you think that is so, professor?"</p>

<p>"It is true, most assuredly. All classifical literature
confirms the statement you have just made."</p>

<p>"Then you don't believe in athletics, do you, professor?"</p>

<p>"Assuredly not. Most assuredly not."</p>

<p>"But didn't the ancient Greeks have their racecourses?
Didn't they believe in running and jumping
and boxing and I don't know what all?"</p>

<p>"That is true, but the times were very different
then. They had not in the least lost the sense of
the poetry of life. They were not so crassly or
grossly materialistic as the present age undoubtedly
is. Every grove was peopled with divinities, every
mountain was the abode of the unseen. Why, Mr.
Phelps, the Greeks were the only people that ever
lived that looked upon mountains as anything but
blots or defects."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" inquired Will in surprise.</p>

<p>"It certainly is. It is true that since the days of
the poet Gray there has been a tendency among English-speaking
people to affect a veneration for the
mountains, but it is, I fawncy, only a faint echo of
the old Greek conception and is a purely superficial
product of an extremely superficial age and people."<a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a>"Didn't the Hebrews have a feeling like the one
you tell of? Isn't there a psalm that begins 'I
will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence
cometh my help'? Didn't they describe the high
hills that were round about Jerusalem?"</p>

<p>"Ah, yes. That is true," assented the professor
in some confusion. "I had not thought of it in that
light precisely. You have given me a new insight
to-day, Mr. Phelps. I shall at once go over my data
again. I am grateful to you for acceding to my
request to remain to-day."</p>

<p>"But, professor," persisted Will, "what about my
work in Greek? I've had a tutor ever since you told
me to get one and I've been working hard too. Today
I didn't do very well, but I was so excited about
the fever, for Peter John&mdash;I mean Schenck&mdash;is one
of the fellows to come down with it, you know, and
we've been telephoning and telegraphing home&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, yes. But you heard my remarks to-day
concerning the necessity of increased work in Greek
as a preventive, did you not?"</p>

<p>"I did. But, professor, I'm willing to work. If
I'm to be shut out of the exam&mdash;I mean the examination&mdash;as
you seem to think I will, anyway, I don't
see any use in my trying any more."</p>

<p>The expression on the professor's face became
instantly harder as he said, "I fawncy the effort to
curry favor with the various members of the faculty
is not very popular with the student body."</p>

<p>"Do you think I'm trying to 'boot-lick'?" demanded
Will quickly.</p>

<p>"I look upon that term as somewhat objection<a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a>able,
but I fawncy in the vernacular of college life
it is one that is quite expressive."</p>

<p>"I'm not trying to boot-lick you or any other professor!"
retorted Will, now feeling angry and insulted
as well. "I didn't stay here to-day because I
wanted to. You yourself asked me to do it. And I
asked you a perfectly fair question. I knew I hadn't
been doing very well, but after I saw you I've been
trying, honestly trying, to do better. And all the
encouragement you give me is to say that if I work
harder I may almost come up to the passing mark."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Mr. Phelps, but you are the one to
change your record, not I. All I do is merely to jot
down what you have been doing. I do not do the
work&mdash;I merely record it."</p>

<p>For a moment Will Phelps was almost speechless
with anger. He felt outraged and insulted in every
fibre of his being. He hastily bade the professor
good-morning, and, seizing his cap, rushed for his
room, a great fear being upon him that unless he
instantly departed he would say or do something for
which he would have a lifelong regret.</p>

<p>As he burst into his room he found Foster already
there, and, flinging his books savagely across the
room, Will seated himself in his easy-chair and
glared at his room-mate.</p>

<p>"Why? What's wrong? What's happened, Will?"
demanded Foster, in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Oh, I've just had another delightful interview
with old Splinter. He's the worst I ever struck yet!"</p>

<p>"Did you strike him, Will?" inquired Foster, a
smile of amusement appearing on his face.</p>

<p>"No, but I'd like to! His soul would get lost in
<a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a>the eye of a needle! He's the smallest specimen I
have ever run up against. He may know Greek, but
he doesn't know anything else. I never in all my
life saw&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tell me about it, Will," interrupted Foster.</p>

<p>Thus bidden, Will related the story of his interview
with his professor of Greek. When Foster
laughed as he told of Splinter's description of his
marvelously increased corpulence, Will did not join,
for the ludicrous side now was all swallowed up
in his anger. And when his room-mate scowled
as he heard of the professor's insinuation that the
young freshman was trying to "boot-lick," Will's
anger broke forth afresh. "What's the use in my
trying, I'd like to know?" he demanded. "I've never
tried harder in my life than I have for the last three
or four weeks. And what does old Splinter have to
say about it? 'Oh, I'm doing better and if I keep
on I'll <i>almost</i> come up to the passing mark!' I tell
you, it isn't fair! It isn't right! He's just determined
to put me out!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps he thinks he's bound to stick to the
marks he's given you before."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's it. But think of it, Foster. Here I
am doing better and putting in my best work. And
the old fellow acknowledges it too, for he says so
himself. But what does it all amount to? He doesn't
give me any credit for what I've been doing lately.
No, he's just tied up to the marks I got at the beginning
of the year. What fairness is there in that,
I'd like to know? That's the way they do in State's
prison, but I didn't suppose old Winthrop was built
exactly on that plan. I thought the great point here
<a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a>was to wake a man up and inspire him to try to do
better and all that sort of thing. And I <i>am</i> doing
better, and I know it, and so does he, but his soul
is so dried up and withered that he can't think
of anything but ancient history. He hasn't the
least idea of what's going on here to-day. I'll bet
the old fellow, when he has the toothache, groans
in dactylic hexameters and calls for his breakfast
in the Ionic dialect. Bah! What's all the stuff
good for anyway? I haven't any reason for trying
any more."</p>

<p>"Yes, you have."</p>

<p>"I have? Well, what is it?"</p>

<p>"Your father, if nothing else."</p>

<p>Will instantly became silent, for Foster's words
only seemed to call up before him the vision of his
father's face. He was the best man that had ever
lived, Will declared to himself, and his conviction
had been strengthened as he had seen the relations
between many of his college mates and their fathers.
How he would be grieved over it all. And yet Will
knew that never an unkind word would be spoken.
It was almost more than he could bear, he thought,
and his eyes were glistening when he arose from his
seat to respond to a knock on the door. As he
opened it he saw standing before him his own
father and the father of Peter John Schenck, and
with a yell of delight he grasped his father's outstretched
hand and pulled him hastily into the room.</p>

<h4>A CRISIS</h4>


<p>In response to Will's eager questions, Mr. Phelps
explained that he had come to Winthrop to satisfy
himself as to the exact status as to the fever that
had broken out. Before he had come up to Will's
room he had consulted the college officials and now
felt that he was in a position to decide calmly what
must be done by his son.</p>

<p>"And what's the verdict?" inquired Will.</p>

<p>"It will not be necessary for you to return. I
think everything is being done that ought to be and
though we shall be anxious, still I am not unduly
alarmed. I have confidence in you, Will, and I am
sure you will not be careless in a time like this.
The president informs me that there have not been
any new cases since the first outbreak, and he is
of the opinion that all these cases were due to one
cause and that was found outside of the village."</p>

<p>"Then you don't want me to go home with you?"
inquired Will quizzically.</p>

<p>"What I might 'want' and what is best are two
different matters," said his father with a smile,
"Just at present what I want and what you need
happen to be one and the same thing."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"Your Greek."</p>

<p>Will's face clouded and then unmindful of the others
who were in the room he told his father of his
recent interview with his professor of Greek. The
smile of amusement on the face of Mr. Phelps when<a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a>
Will began soon gave way to an expression of deep
concern. To Will, who understood him so thoroughly,
it was evident that his father was angry as
well as disappointed, and for a moment there was a
feeling of exultation in his own heart. Now something
would be done, he felt confident, and the injustice
under which he was laboring and suffering
would be done away.</p>

<p>"Your other work is all right, Will?" inquired his
father after a brief silence.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! Fine! If old Splinter was only half the
man that Professor Sinclair is, there wouldn't be a
bit of trouble. Why the recitation in Latin never
seems to be more than fifteen minutes long. But the
Greek&mdash;bah! The hour is like a week of Sundays!"</p>

<p>"Still, Will, there is only one way out of it for
you."</p>

<p>"I suppose so," responded Will, his heart sinking
as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Yes, it must be faced. I know it's hard, but you
can't get around it, Will, and I'm sure you don't
want to run from it. As I told you, it isn't as if your
Greek professor was the only one of his kind you
will meet in life, for his name is legion and you will
find him everywhere. The only thing for you to do
is to keep on with your tutor and prove yourself to
be the master. If you do that, the experience, hard
as it is, may prove to be one of the best that could
come to you."</p>

<p>Will was silent for a moment before he spoke, and
then he said impulsively, "Well, pop, I suppose you
are right. I'll do my best."<a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a>"Of course you will," responded his father quietly,
though his eyes were shining. "It isn't so hard for
you as it is for Mr. Schenck."</p>

<p>"Is Peter John worse?" inquired Will quickly.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Isn't there something we can do?" said Will
eagerly.</p>

<p>"No, nothing," said Mr. Schenck. "My boy is
very sick, but all we can do is to wait. He is having
good care. The only comfort I have is what they
tell me about him and what he has been doing since
he came to college."</p>

<p>Both boys looked up quickly, but neither spoke and
Mr. Schenck continued. "Yes, there's a young man
I have met since I've been here who has told me
many things about my boy that comfort me now
very much."</p>

<p>"Was it Mott?" interrupted Will.</p>

<p>"Yes, that was his name. You know him too, I
see. He seems to be a very fine young man. He
told me that Peter was one of the leaders in his class,
and that everybody in the college knew him. He
said too, that he had won his numerals&mdash;though I
don't just understand what that means."</p>

<p>"It means that he has the right to wear the number
of his class on his cap or sweater," said Will.
"That's more than I've won." He had not the heart
to undeceive the unhappy man, though both he and
Foster were aware that Mott had been overstating
the facts in his desire to comfort Peter John's father.</p>

<p>"Well, I hope he'll get well," said Mr. Schenck
with a heavy sigh, "though it does seem as if such
things always happened to the brightest boys. I'm
<a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a>going to stay here for a few days till I know he's
better or&mdash;" The sentence was not completed and
for a time there was a tense silence in the room.</p>

<p>At last the men departed, Mr. Schenck to go to his
son's room where he was to sleep while he remained
in Winthrop, and Mr. Phelps to the station where he
was to take the train for his home. Will accompanied
his father, but the subject that was uppermost
in the mind of each was not referred to for
there are times when silence is golden.</p>

<p>In the days that followed, Will Phelps worked as
he never had worked before in all his brief life. His
distaste for the Greek and dislike of the professor
were as strong as before, and at times it almost
seemed to him that he could no longer continue the
struggle. His sole inspiration was in the thought
of his father and in his blind determination not to be
mastered.</p>

<p>An additional element of gloom in those days were
the reports that came from the infirmary of the condition
of Peter John. All the other patients appeared
to be doing well, but the daily word from the
watchers by Peter John's bedside was that he was
worse. A pall seemed to be resting over the entire
college. The noisy songs and boisterous shouts were
not heard in the dormitories nor upon the campus.</p>

<p>A part of the general anxiety was gone when as
the days passed there were no reports of new cases
developed, but the fear of what was to be the issue
in the case of Peter John was in every heart&mdash;even
with those who had not exchanged a word with him
since he had entered Winthrop.</p>

<p>Will Phelps found himself even wondering how it
<a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a>was that the "old grads" when they returned always
spoke in such enthusiastic terms of their own college
days. How they laughed and slapped one another
on the back as they recalled and recounted their exploits.
It was Will's conviction that those days must
have been markedly different from those through
which he was passing, for he was finding only hard
work and much trouble, he dolefully assured himself.
He was too inexperienced to understand that
one is never able to see clearly the exact condition
of present experiences. There is then no perspective,
and the good and evil, the large and small, are
strangely confused. It is like the figures in a
Chinese picture wherein the background and foreground,
the little and the big, are much the same in
their proportions. Only when a man looks back and
beholds the events of the bygone days in their true
perspective is he able to form a correct estimate of
the relative values. Even Will Phelps would not
have believed that there might come a day when the
very struggle he was having in mastering his Greek
would be looked upon by him as not unpleasant in
the larger light in which all his college days would
be viewed.</p>

<p>Mr. Schenck still remained in Winthrop, and his
face every morning when Will went to inquire about
Peter John was a sure indication of the report which
was to be made even before a word had been spoken.
Steadily lower and lower sank the freshman, who
was desperately ill, until at last the crisis came,
and with the passing of the day the issue of life or
death would be determined.</p>

<p>In the interval between his recitations Will ran
<a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a>to see the suffering man and learn how the issue was
going, and when at last the word was received that
Peter John, if no relapse occurred, was likely to
recover, he felt as if a great load had been lifted
from his mind. It was his first experience with
the deep tragedy that, like a cloud, rests over all
mankind, and in the glimmer of hope that now appeared
it seemed to him that all things appeared
in a new light. Even his detested Greek was not
quite so bad as it previously had been, and in the
reaction that came Will bent to his distasteful task
with a renewed determination.</p>

<p>When several weeks had elapsed, and the time of
the Christmas vacation was near, for the first time
Will was permitted to enter the room where Peter
John was sitting up in bed. It was difficult for
Will to hide the shock that came when he first saw
his classmate, his face wasted till it almost seemed
as if the bones must protrude, his head shaved, and
his general weakness so apparent as to be pathetic.</p>

<p>Striving to conceal his real feelings and to appear
bright and cheery, Will extended his hand and said
nervously: "I'm mighty glad to see you, Peter
John, and so will all the fellows be. I don't think
you've taken the best way of getting a vacation."</p>

<p>Peter John smiled in a way that almost brought
the tears to Will's eyes, and said, "I'm much obliged
to you, Will."</p>

<p>"No, you're not. We're all much obliged to you
for getting well. I don't know what the track team
would have done without you."</p>

<p>"Guess I won't bother the track team this year.
That's what the doctor says."<a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a>"Oh, well," said Will hastily, "that won't make
any difference. You'll be all right for another year
and that will do just as well."</p>

<p>"Say, Will," said Peter after a brief pause:</p>

<p>"What is it?" inquired Will kindly.</p>

<p>"There's something I want to say to you."</p>

<p>"Say it, then," laughed Will.</p>

<p>"I'm never going to touch a drop again."</p>

<p>"That's all right. Of course you won't," assented
Will cordially.</p>

<p>"And, Will&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"I'm not going to have anything charged up to you
any more."</p>

<p>"'Anything charged up to me'? I don't know
what you mean."</p>

<p>"I mean those cakes and pies I had charged to you
down at Tommie's." "Tommie" was the name by
which the proprietor of one of the little restaurants
and bakeshops in Winthrop was familiarly called
by the college boys.</p>

<p>"I didn't know you had anything charged to me."</p>

<p>"You didn't?"</p>

<p>"No. I haven't had any bill for it, anyway."</p>

<p>"You'll get it. You'll have one," said Peter John
nodding his head decidedly. "I don't know what I
ever did it for anyway. At first I thought it was a
good joke on you. M&mdash;some of the fellows said it
would be. And then somehow I kept it up."</p>

<p>"Never mind, Peter John. I'll fix it. It'll be all
right."</p>

<p>"Did you tell my father?" inquired Peter John
anxiously.<a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a>"No. I haven't told him anything."</p>

<p>"I'm glad. I lost some money on that trip with
the football team, Will."</p>

<p>"How much?"</p>

<p>"Seven dollars and a half. It was all I'd got."</p>

<p>"Do you want&mdash;" Will started to take out his
pocketbook, but stopped abruptly, for he was not certain
just how Peter John might receive his offer.
He did not see the light that came for a moment into
his classmate's eyes or the look of disappointment
that quickly followed it.</p>

<p>"I'm never going to bet any more," remarked
Peter John simply.</p>

<p>"Of course not."</p>

<p>"But my money is gone and I sha'n't be able to
pay for those things I had charged to you at Tommie's,
as I fully meant to."</p>

<p>"Never mind that."</p>

<p>"I'm going to study harder too."</p>

<p>"Not just yet. I shouldn't bother my head about
such things now, Peter John. Wait till you are up
and around before you do that."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid that'll be a long time."</p>

<p>"No. Oh no, it won't," said Will cheerily. "You'll
be all right before you know it."</p>

<p>Peter John shook his head and was about to reply,
when Mott entered the room and at the same time
the physician also came. The latter glanced keenly
at his patient, and then said to the visitors, "That's
enough this time, boys. You'd better cut it short
now and come again."</p>

<p>Will and Mott at once departed after bidding<a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a>
Peter John good-bye, and when they were out on
the sidewalk Mott began to laugh.</p>

<p>"What's struck you? I don't see anything so
very funny," said Will irritated by his companion's
manner.</p>

<p>"Peter John has made a clean breast of it."</p>

<p>"What of it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing much. Only when the 'devil was
sick the devil a monk would be.' You know the
words probably. It strikes me as absolutely funny."</p>

<p>"I don't see anything to laugh about," retorted
Will warmly.</p>

<p>"You wait and maybe you will later, Phelps. Tra,
la, freshman!" and Mott abruptly departed.</p>

<p>His words, however, still lingered in Will's mind,
and throughout the evening the jingling rhyme that
the sophomore had repeated kept running through
his thoughts.</p>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h3>

<h4>THE EXAMINATION</h4>


<p>Vacation had come and gone. How Will Phelps did
enjoy that break in his work! He almost begrudged
the swiftly passing hours while he was at home,
and as the vacation drew near its close he found
himself computing the hours and even the minutes
that yet remained before he must return, just as
he had previously reckoned the time that must pass
before he could return to Sterling. It was not that
he did not enjoy his college life, for as we know
he had entered heartily into its spirit, but the work
was hard and his handicap in the one subject had
robbed him of the enthusiasm which perhaps otherwise
he might have had.</p>

<p>When the day at last arrived when he was to
return he was unusually quiet and seldom had a
word to say to any one. Uppermost in his thoughts
was the expression of the principal of the school
where he had prepared for college, who had said to
him: "Well, Will, with all the fun of college there
is still another side to it, and that is, that when a
fellow enters college he really is leaving home. From
that time forward he may come back for his vacations,
but it is nevertheless the break that sooner or
later comes to every man." Will had thought much
of the saying, and its truthfulness was so apparent
that he was unable entirely to shake off the somewhat
depressing effect it had produced upon himself.</p>

<p>When the hour came and the good-byes must be
said he strove desperately to be calm, but he dared
<a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a>not trust himself to say much. He did not once
glance behind him as he walked away from the
house to the street, though he knew that his father
and mother were standing on the piazza and were
watching him as long as his sturdy form could be
seen by them.</p>

<p>On the train he found several of his college friends
and it became somewhat easier for him in their company
to forget his own heaviness of heart, and as he
sped on toward Winthrop the numbers increased and
the noisy shouts of greeting and the enthusiasm of
the students diverted him from the feeling to which
otherwise he might have yielded.</p>

<p>Peter John and Foster were in the number of the
returning students, the former having recovered
sufficiently to warrant him in taking up a part of his
work. Wagner also and several of the other students
who had been victims of the fever were on the train
when it arrived at Winthrop, and in the warmth of
their reception by their student friends there was
a tonic such as even the physicians' prescriptions
had not afforded. Will found a slight return of his
depression when he first entered his room, but when
a few days had passed his life had once more settled
into the grooves of the daily routine and assumed
its former round of tasks.</p>

<p>The mid-year examinations came within a month
after the reopening of the college, and the chagrin
and anger of Will Phelps were keenly aroused when
he learned that although he had done well in his
other studies he was conditioned in his Greek. He
stormed and raved about the injustice with which
he was being treated, and finally, at Foster's sug<a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a>gestion,
sought a personal interview with his professor.</p>

<p>"I don't understand it, professor," he said warmly.
"I never felt more sure of anything in my life than I
did that I had passed that exam&mdash;I mean that examination."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," replied the professor. "Quite likely
if you had had the decision to make, you would have
passed <i>cum laude!</i> Ha, ha! Yes, I fawncy it might
have been so, but unfortunately the decision had
to be made by other parties."</p>

<p>"But didn't I pass the examination, professor?"
demanded Will.</p>

<p>"I do not exactly recollect as to that. Quite likely
you failed, since that impression seems to be vivid in
your thoughts. Were you so reported?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Have you got that paper, professor?"</p>

<p>"I <i>have</i> it. I should not say I have <i>got</i> it."</p>

<p>"May I see it?" Will's manner was subdued, but
there was a flush on his cheeks which those who
knew him well would at once have understood.</p>

<p>"I will look it over with you," assented the professor.
"It is against our rules to return papers to
students, and I fawncy our rules are made to be
obeyed, not ignored."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir." Will was hardly aware of what he
was saying so impatient and eager was he for the
paper to be produced.</p>

<p>The professor unlocked a drawer in his desk and
drew forth a package of papers that were carefully
tied with a piece of ribbon. Even the knot was
exact and the loop on one side did not vary from
that on the other by the smallest fraction. In his
<a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a>impatience Will noticed even this detail, but it was
ignored in a moment when the professor slowly and
with care examined the headlines of the papers and
at last drew forth one which he placed on the desk
in front of him and said: "Ah, yes. Here is the
paper in question. It is credited with being two
points above the mark required to pass a student."</p>

<p>"It is?" demanded Will enthusiastically. "I
thought there must be a mistake."</p>

<p>There was a slight scowl on the professor's brow
as he said: "Ah, yes. I will now refer to your true
mark," and he drew forth a little book as he spoke
and carefully examined the record. "Ah, yes," he
murmured, not lifting his eyes from the page on
which he had placed a forefinger. "Ah, yes. It is
as I fawncied. Your average for the term in your
recitations is what brings you below. It is true you
are two above the required mark in your examination,
but you are three below in your recitation work,
and that, I regret exceedingly to say, brings you
still one point below the mark necessary to pass
you." The professor looked up and smiled blandly.</p>

<p>But Will Phelps was not smiling and his vigorous
young heart was filled with wrath. By a desperate
effort, however, he contrived to control his voice
and said quietly: "Was I not doing better? Was I
not improving in my work?"</p>

<p>"I should not care to speak positively, but my
impression is that you were. Ah, yes," he added as
he glanced again at his record. "You were improving.
I may even say there was a marked improvement."</p>

<p>"And I passed the exam?"<a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a></p>

<p>"I have told you that you were two points above
the mark required for passing the examination,"
said the professor with dignity.</p>

<p>"Then I don't see what I'm stuck for."</p>

<p>"You are not 'stuck'."</p>

<p>"I'm not? Thank you, professor. I thought I
was. You can't understand what a load&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Excuse me, Mr. Phelps. I did not affirm that
you were not conditioned. I merely declared that
you were not 'stuck'."</p>

<p>"Then I am conditioned, am I?" said Will, his
heart instantly sinking.</p>

<p>"Most certainly."</p>

<p>"What shall I have to do?"</p>

<p>"Pass the examination."</p>

<p>"But I have passed it! I passed this one!" declared
Will promptly.</p>

<p>Again the professor's scowl returned and his thin
lips were tightly compressed as he said, "I fawncy it
will not be necessary for me to repeat what I have
already said. You were deficient in the term work
and therefore are conditioned."</p>

<p>"Then you mean to tell me, do you," said Will, no
longer able to repress his rising indignation, "that,
though I steadily improved in my class work, and
then passed the examination, in spite of it all you
are going to give me a condition because according
to your figures I am still one point below?"</p>

<p>"Most certainly."</p>

<p>"And I'll have to take another exam?"</p>

<p>"Precisely."</p>

<p>"Good evening, professor," said Will, rising
abruptly.<a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a>There was nothing more to be said, and he felt
that it would be wise to withdraw from the professor's
presence before, in his indignation, he
should say something he was certain to regret. When,
however, he returned to his own room, there the
flood tides of his wrath broke loose. He related the
interview to Foster, and bitterly declared that if a
smaller specimen of a man could be found with a
microscope he thought he would be willing to spend
his days and nights searching for him. There was
neither justice nor fairness in it. He had improved
steadily, even Splinter acknowledged that he had,
and had passed the required exam, and yet for the
sake of the professor's pettiness and the red tape
of the college rules he must take another, and then
if he should pass <i>that</i> he would be all right. Bah!
Greek was bad enough, but Splinter was worse.
What kind of a man was he to put in charge of a
lot of fellows with live blood in their veins, he'd like
to know. For his part he wished he was out of it.
Such things might do for kids, but it was too contemptible
to think of for college students.</p>

<p>Foster wisely waited till the outburst had been
ended and then said, "Well, Will, you're up against
it, whatever you say. What are you going to do
about it?"</p>

<p>"Do about it? I'm going to pass that exam.
There isn't any other way out. I've got to do it!
but that doesn't make it any nicer for me, does it?"</p>

<p>"Splinter's here and is likely to stay. And if you
and I are going to stay too, I suppose we'll have to
come to his tune."</p>

<p>"I fancy&mdash;you should hear Splinter say that."<a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a>"Say what?"</p>

<p>"'Fancy,' only he calls it 'fawncy'. I 'fawncy' my
father is dead right when he says that I'll find a
splinter everywhere and just as long as I live; but
I don't believe I'll ever find one as bad as this one is."</p>

<p>"He may be worse. Don't you remember that little
bit of Eugene Field's verse where he tells how
when he was a boy he was sliding down hill with
some other little chaps in front of the deacon's
house? And how their yelling annoyed the deacon
till at last he came out and sprinkled ashes on the
path? Well, Eugene said he always had found since
that there was some one standing ready to throw
ashes on his path, it didn't seem to make any difference
where he was."</p>

<p>"I don't remember, but it's like my father's words
about finding splinters everywhere. Oh, no, I'm mad
about it, but I'm not running away. I'm going to do
it if that's the thing to be done."</p>

<p>And when a month had gone by Will had passed
the examination, and was facing his work without
the drag of work undone to hinder him.</p>

<p>The final influence had come one Sunday in the
college chapel where the pulpit from week to week
was occupied ("filled" was a word also occasionally
used) by men of eminence, who were invited for the
purpose of speaking to the college boys. Some of
these visitors by words, presence, and message were
a great inspiration to the young men, and others
were correspondingly deficient, for in the vocabulary
of Winthrop there was no word by which to express
the comparative degree.</p>

<p>Will Phelps had regularly attended the services,
<a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a>not only because such attendance was required by the
college authorities but also from the habit and inclination
of his own life. With his fellows he had
enjoyed some speakers and had disliked others in
his thoughtless manner, and in the preceding week
had laughed as heartily as any one over the unconscious
escapade of Mott. The preacher for the day
had been unusually prosy, having length without
much breadth or thickness as Foster had dryly described
the discourse, and in the midst of the hour,
Mott had fallen asleep in his pew. Short and stout
in figure, doubtless doubly wearied by the late hours
he had kept the preceding night, in the midst of his
slumbers he had begun to snore. From low and
peaceful intonations he had passed on to long, prolonged,
and sonorous notes that could be heard
throughout the college chapel. Nor would any one
of his fellows disturb his slumbers, and when at last
with an unusually loud and agonizing gasp Mott
was awakened and suddenly sat erect and stared
stupidly about him, the good-hearted, but boyishly
irreverent audience, it is safe to affirm, was decidedly
more interested in the slumbering sophomore
than in the soporific speaker, though few doubtless
thought them related as cause and effect.</p>

<p>On the following Sunday Will was thinking of
Mott's experience and wondering if he would give
another exhibition. This thought was even in his
mind when the visiting speaker entered the chapel
pulpit and reverently began the service of the day.</p>

<p>He had not been speaking long before it was evident
that every eye was fastened upon him. It was
evident that here was first of all a man, and then a
<a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a>man who was present because he had something to
say and not merely because he had to say something.</p>

<p>"I am appealing to those of you," he was saying,
"who are eager and earnest, not to you who are
indifferent or weaklings. Those of you who are
members of your college teams, who are leading
spirits in the college life, who are not living lives
that are above reproach because you have no temptation
to be bad, but because if you do right it is because
you have to struggle and fight for it&mdash;it is to
you I am speaking this morning."</p>

<p>Will was listening intently, as was every one in
the chapel, and then there followed a sentence that
seemed to him almost electric with life and that
made a lasting impression upon his life.</p>



<hr /><p><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a></p>
<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h3>

<h4>A FRESH EXCITEMENT</h4>


<p>"What I want every one of you young men to do,"
the speaker was saying, "is to give your better self
a chance. There isn't one of you to-day who is not
proud of his physical strength, not one of you who,
if he should be urged to join one of the athletic
teams, would not willingly, even proudly go through
all the training that would be required of him. And
that is right. In your intellectual work some of you
see what the desired end is&mdash;the development of
power, getting your brains into form so that you
can meet and compete with the forces you will have
to face when you leave your college days behind you
and go forth to make your name and place in the
great battlefield of life. Some of you, it may be, do
not as yet see this clearly, and when you can evade
a task or dodge a difficult demand upon you, count
it as so much gained. But in your heart of hearts
you know better, and are dimly conscious that you
are losing and not gaining by your neglect."</p>

<p>The earnestness, the sincerity, and naturalness of
the speaker acted upon Will Phelps with the effect of
an electric shock. Never had he been so thoroughly
aroused, and every nerve in his body was tingling
when he left the chapel and started toward his own
room.</p>

<p>"That's the kind of a talk the fellows like."</p>

<p>Will glanced up and beheld Wagner, who had overtaken
him and now was walking by his side.<a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a>"I never heard such a man in all my life," said
Will warmly.</p>

<p>"There isn't a man that comes here who has such
a grip on the students as he has. One of the best
things you have to look forward to is the treat you
will have every year of hearing him. There isn't a
spark of 'cant' or 'gush' about him, but what he says
goes straight home. I don't think I'll ever forget
some of the things he has said to us while I've been
in college."</p>

<p>Accepting Will's cordial invitation, Wagner went
with him to his room and remained there for an
hour, and for the most of the time their conversation
was of the man and the message they had that morning
heard.</p>

<p>"I'll never forget one thing he said," remarked
Wagner thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"What was that?" inquired Will, deeply interested
at once.</p>

<p>"He was talking once about the reason why women
were supposed to be so much more religious than
men, and he said he didn't believe they were."</p>

<p>"There are more in the churches, anyway," suggested
Will.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's what he said; but he said too, that the
reason for it was because one side of the life of
Christ had been emphasized at the expense of the
other. He said so much had been made of his gentleness
and meekness and the kindly virtues, which
were the feminine side of his nature and appealed
most to women, that he was afraid sometimes the
other the stronger side and the one that appealed
most to men had been lost. And then, he went on to
<a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a>speak of the Lion of the tribe of Judah, and he pictured
the temptation and the power of decision and
the heroic endurance and strength, and all that. I
never heard anything like it in all my life. It made
me feel as I do when the team is in for a meet. I'll
never forget it! Never!"</p>

<p>"I wish I'd heard it."</p>

<p>"You'll have three more chances, anyway."</p>

<p>"Maybe more than that if I don't pass in all my
work," laughed Will.</p>

<p>"Having any trouble?"</p>

<p>"A little with my Greek, but I've passed off my
condition now."</p>

<p>"I think you're all right then, though Splinter is a
hard proposition. Just imagine him talking like
this man this morning."</p>

<p>Will laughed, and then becoming serious, he said,
"Wagner, I've a classmate who is bothering me."</p>

<p>"Who is it?"</p>

<p>"Schenck. Peter John everybody calls him."</p>

<p>"What's he doing? What's the trouble with
him?"</p>

<p>"Well, to be honest, he's drinking hard."</p>

<p>"Wasn't he one of the fellows who was down, with
the typhoid when I had it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"An awkward, ungainly, redheaded fellow?"</p>

<p>"That's the one."</p>

<p>"What have you been doing for him?"</p>

<p>"Everything I could think of, but nothing seems to
hold. He made all sorts of promises when he was
sick and he hasn't kept one of them. He goes around
with Mott and you know what that means."<a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a>"Yes," said Wagner thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"He's a queer chap. I was in school three years
with him and in some ways he was absolutely idiotic.
For a while he'd work all right and then without a
word of warning he'd break out and do some of the
most absolutely fool things you ever heard of."</p>

<p>"Not very much to appeal to, I fancy."</p>

<p>"There might be if a fellow knew how, but I confess
I don't."</p>

<p>"You think it would do any good for me to see
him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do," said Will eagerly. "You know he
might stand a show for the track team&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is he the fellow that won the half-mile in the
sophomore-freshman meet?" inquired Wagner eagerly.
"Is he the one?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I'll see him. I'll go right over there now. You're
not letting up any in your own work for the team
are you, Phelps?"</p>

<p>"I'm doing a little all the time," Will admitted,
"but I don't suppose it will amount to much."</p>

<p>"Yes, it will. You never can tell till you try. If
Mott does not do better he'll find himself out of it.
We'll need you and every one we can get. You
know I can't go in this year."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"The typhoid. Doctor won't let me."</p>

<p>"Then Peter John can't go in either."</p>

<p>"That's so. I hadn't thought of that. All the
more reason then why you ought to do your best,
Phelps. I'll see this John Henry anyway&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You mean Peter John."<a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a>"All right. Have it your own way. I'll go over
to his room and look him up anyway. Good-bye,
Phelps."</p>

<p>"Good-bye," responded Will, as the senior started
down the stairway.</p>

<p>Several days elapsed before Will heard anything of
Wagner's interview with Peter John and then all
that Wagner told him was that the freshman had
promised faithfully to do better. But Will had already
had so much experience with Peter John's
promises that he was somewhat skeptical as to results.
His classmate he knew was not essentially
vicious, only weak. He was so weak and vain that
he was eager to gain the favor of whatever person
he chanced to be with, and his promise of better
things to Wagner was as readily given as was his response
to Mott when the latter happened to be his
companion of the hour.</p>

<p>Troubled as Will was, he nevertheless did for
Peter John all that was within his power, which
was not much, and was heavy-hearted as the reports
steadily came of his classmate's downfall. Even
Hawley, good-natured as he was, had at last rebelled
and declared that he would no longer room with a
fellow who had no more sense than Schenck, and
Peter John, left to himself, was quick to respond to
Mott's invitation to share his room, and was soon
domiciled in the sophomore's more luxurious
quarters.</p>

<p>Will Phelps found meanwhile that his own work in
the classroom was of a character that promised a fair
grade, though by no means a high one. Even his
professor of Greek now appeared in a slightly more
<a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a>favorable light, and Will was convinced that the
change was in Splinter, not in himself, so natural
and strong were his boyish prejudices.</p>

<p>As the springtime drew near, however, his
thoughts and time were somewhat divided in the excitement
of the last great struggle between the members
of his own class and their rivals, the sophomores.
For years it had been the custom of the college
for the two lower classes to bury, or rather to
burn the hatchet on St. Patrick's Day. For a week
preceding that time the tussles between the rival
classes were keener than at any other time during
the year.</p>

<p>At that eventful date the freshmen for the first
time were permitted to carry canes, and on the day
itself there was to be a parade of the freshman class,
every member clad in some outlandish garment
which he wore outside his other clothing, and it was
the one ambition of the sophomore class to silence
the music of the band that was at the head of the
procession and at the same time tear the outer garments
from the noisy freshmen. For a week preceding
the time of the parade the freshmen were
striving by every means in their power to smuggle
their canes into Winthrop so that they would all be
supplied when the day of emancipation arrived, and
the test of the sophomores' keenness was in being
able to thwart the plans of their adversaries and
prevent the entrance of the canes into the town.</p>

<p>Every road leading to the village was strictly
guarded by the vigilant sophomores and spies were
busy in the adjacent towns who were continually on
the lookout for the purchase or purchasers of the
<a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a>canes. The excitement had become keener with the
passing of the days until now only two days remained
before the great parade when the huge
wooden hatchet would be borne at the head of the
procession and duly consigned to the flames on the
lower campus in the presence of the entire student
body.</p>

<p>Will and Foster had shared in the growing interest
and both knew just where the coveted canes had
been purchased by the duly authorized committee
and hidden till the time should arrive when they
were to be brought stealthily into the village. Their
excitement became keener still when on the evening
of the day to which reference has been made Peter
John Schenck burst into Will's room with a report
that instantly aroused his two friends.</p>



<hr /><p><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a></p>
<h3><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h3>

<h4>THE RUSH TO COVENTRY CENTER</h4>


<p>"The sophs have found out where the canes are,"
Peter John almost shouted.</p>

<p>"They have? How do you know?" demanded
Will.</p>

<p>"I was in my bedroom and I heard them talking
with Mott in our study room."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Tucker, Spencer, and Goodman."</p>

<p>"What did they say?"</p>

<p>"They said the canes were over in Coventry
Center, at the minister's house there."</p>

<p>Coventry Center was a little hamlet about seven
miles distant from Winthrop, and the excited freshmen
had indeed stored a part of their canes in the
house of the worthy old minister of the village.
They had frankly explained to him what their purpose
was and he had laughingly consented to receive
the coveted possessions in his home and store them
there for the four days that intervened between the
time and St. Patrick's day. And the freshmen had
been confident that their hiding-place would not
readily be discovered. No one would suspect that
the parsonage would be selected or the worthy minister
would act as a guard. To make assurance
doubly certain, however, only half of the canes
had been entrusted to the minister, and even those
were divided&mdash;a bundle containing a dozen being
placed in the woodshed and the remaining being
stored beneath the hay in the little loft of the barn.<a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a>
The other half of the class canes had been taken
to a farmhouse a mile distant from the parsonage
and there concealed in an unused well, the mouth of
which was filled with rubbish and the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of a
shed that had been blown down by a severe windstorm
that had occurred a few weeks before this
time.</p>

<p>As the utmost care had been observed by the
committee having in charge the purchase of the
canes, and they had stealthily in a stormy night
taken their precious burdens to the two places of
concealment they had been confident, over-confident
now it appeared, that their actions had not been
discovered.</p>

<p>Will and Foster had both served on the committee
that had purchased and hidden the canes, and when
Peter John brought his unwelcome tidings that
the rival class was aware of the place where the
canes had been stored, it was difficult for them to
determine whether anger or chagrin was uppermost
in their feelings. At all events they both were
greatly excited, and Will said as he hastily rose from
his chair:</p>

<p>"How did they find it out?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I didn't hear them say," replied
Peter John.</p>

<p>"Did they find out that you were there?"</p>

<p>"No, they left before I came out of my room.
The door was partly open and I didn't dare stir
hand or foot."</p>

<p>"Lucky for you, Peter John."</p>

<p>"Yes. I know it."<a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a>"What are they going to do?" inquired Foster,
who up to this time had been silent.</p>

<p>"They've gone over to get the canes."</p>

<p>"Gone!" exclaimed Will aghast.</p>

<p>"Yes. That's what Goodman said."</p>

<p>"How many went, do you know, Peter John?" demanded
Foster.</p>

<p>"He said three."</p>

<p>"Do you know who they were?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"When did they start?"</p>

<p>"Goodman said they went about an hour ago."</p>

<p>"Which road?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"Why didn't Mott go?"</p>

<p>"I don't think he knew anything about it before
these fellows came and told him."</p>

<p>"What did he do after they told him?"</p>

<p>"He slapped his legs and laughed."</p>

<p>"You say he went away with those fellows that
told him about it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Did they say anything about any other
canes&mdash;" began Will. But he was sharply interrupted
by Foster and abruptly ceased.</p>

<p>"I didn't know there were any others," said Peter
John. "Are there? Where are they?"</p>

<p>"We haven't any time to waste here," said Foster,
hastily donning his sweater and putting a cap on his
head. "Peter John, you go back to your room, and
if you hear of anything more go straight to Bishop
with the word."</p>

<p>"I'd rather go with you fellows."<a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a>"Not this trip. You'll have to be on the lookout
here. Somebody must do it and you're the one,
Peter John. Come on, Will," he added, calling to his
room-mate and instantly departed from the room.</p>

<p>Ignoring Peter John, Will hastily followed Foster,
and together the two freshmen ran to Hawley's
room. There a hurried consultation was held, the
result of which was that it was decided that Foster
and Dana should secure a car and drive
swiftly to Coventry Center by one road, two other
classmates were to drive to the same destination by
another road, while Will and Hawley were to go
on foot across the country and strive to arrive at
the minister's house by the time the others had done
so. In this way it was believed that every avenue
of approach or retreat would be covered, and that
even if the sophomores had been first on the scene
they would still be unable to get away with their
booty before they would be discovered, and at least
followed.</p>

<p>In a brief time Will and Hawley were on their
way across the country, leaving their more fortunate
comrades, who were to ride, to follow as soon as
their conveyances could be secured. The ground
was still frozen, and in places there were patches
of snow and ice, although the heavy snowfall of the
winter for the most part was gone. Their way led
through woods and over plowed fields, but the steady
run or "trot" was maintained uphill and down, and
within an hour and a half from the time they had
departed from Winthrop they arrived at the confines
of the little hamlet of Coventry Center.</p>

<p>"See or hear anything, Will?" inquired Hawley,
<a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a>as the two freshmen stopped and listened intently
as they peered all about them.</p>

<p>"Not a thing," whispered Will in response.</p>

<p>The lights in the little homes were already out,
for the people of Coventry Center were not believers
in keeping untimely hours, and the twinkling lights
of the little village for the most part disappeared
before ten o'clock arrived. It was about that hour
when Will Phelps and Hawley stopped at the end
of the one straggling street to try to discover if there
were any signs of the presence of their enemies or
classmates.</p>

<p>"Shall we wait or put straight for the minister's
house?" inquired Hawley.</p>

<p>"Go there," replied Will.</p>

<p>"Look out! Don't let any one see you," said Hawley
in a low voice as they stealthily began to make
their way up the street. Occasionally they stopped
to make sure that they were not being followed or
to strive to discover if their own friends were near.
They had passed the little white wooden church
building and were approaching the parsonage when
both stopped abruptly.</p>

<p>"What's that?" demanded Hawley in a whisper.</p>

<p>"You know as much about it as I do. Come on
and we'll find out."</p>

<p>The sound of voices could be heard from the rear
of the house and from the tones it was evident that
the speakers were somewhat excited. Furthermore
Will was positive that he recognized the voices of
two and they were members of the sophomore class
at Winthrop.</p>

<p>"How many are there?" whispered Hawley.<a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a>"Sounds as if there were six or eight. Hark!
There's the minister talking."</p>

<p>"What's he saying?"</p>

<p>"I can't make out. He's excited over something,
though."</p>

<p>"Come on," whispered Hawley, "let's creep up
around the corner of the barn. We can see and hear
too there, and if we're careful they won't suspect us."</p>

<p>"It will be all day with us if they do," whispered
Will in response.</p>

<p>Slowly and cautiously the two freshmen crept
along the side of the street and diagonally across the
vacant field till they had gained the desired corner
of the barn. Then crouching low they peered forth
at the sight which could be seen in the dim light.</p>

<p>On the highest step of the rear piazza of his house
stood Mr. Whitaker, the minister of Coventry Center.
He was a man at least sixty-five years of age,
genial and shrewd, the friend of every one in the
region. On the ground before him now five men
could be seen and neither Will nor Hawley had any
difficulty in recognizing all five as sophomores. Will
pinched Hawley's arm in his excitement, but did not
speak, though it almost seemed to him that the
thumpings of his heart must betray his presence to
the men who were before him.</p>

<p>Mr. Whitaker was speaking and instantly Will's
attention was centered upon what was being said.
"No, young gentlemen, I am not willing that you
should enter my house."</p>

<p>"But, Mr. Whitaker," said one in reply whom Will
took to be a sophomore who roomed near him in<a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a>
Perry Hall, "we don't want to come into the house&mdash;just
into the woodshed, that's all."</p>

<p>"I cannot consent even to that."</p>

<p>"We'll not harm anything."</p>

<p>"You certainly will not if you do not enter."</p>

<p>"We've got to come in, Mr. Whitaker!" said the
speaker a little more boldly.</p>

<p>"And I forbid it."</p>

<p>An interval in the conversation then followed during
which Will could see that the sophomores were
conferring. They had withdrawn to a place about
midway between the house and the barn and consequently
were nearer the hiding-place of the two
freshmen than before, but both were compelled to
draw back for fear of being discovered and consequently
were unable to hear what was said.</p>

<p>In a brief time the sophomores returned to the
piazza where the minister was still standing. "Mr.
Whitaker," began the leader.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. At your service," responded the minister
pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Why do you object to our coming in? You know
we won't do any harm to the place. You know what
we've come for."</p>

<p>"Perhaps that's the very reason why I object."</p>

<p>"You don't have to stay here. We'll give you our
word we won't harm anything. All we want is to
get those freshmen canes. You're not responsible
for them and you certainly don't mean to say that
you would stand up for that class. Why it's the
worst that ever entered Winthrop."</p>

<p>"I have frequently heard of the class," said the
<a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a>minister laughing genially as he spoke. "I have a
grandson who chances to be a member of it."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon. I didn't mean to say that
every fellow in it was a poor stick. All I meant
was that as a class it's the most conceited one that
was ever seen. That's what every one says."</p>

<p>"Doubtless," remarked Mr. Whitaker dryly.</p>

<p>"You don't care anything about the squabbles of
the classes. It's nothing to you anyway, Mr. Whitaker,"
pleaded the sophomore.</p>

<p>"What led you to suspect that the canes might
be here?"</p>

<p>"It wouldn't be fair to tell that," laughed the
sophomore. "We know they're here all right, and
that's enough."</p>

<p>"Would you believe me if I were to say to you
that they are not here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I suppose we should," replied the sophomore
dubiously, "but you won't say it."</p>

<p>"Why not, since they are not here?"</p>

<p>"What?" demanded the entire party almost together.</p>

<p>"That is what I said. The canes are not in my
house."</p>

<p>"In the barn, then?" said the leader suspiciously.</p>

<p>"No, they are not in the barn, either. There is
not a cane on my place except the one I occasionally
use myself. If you think that will do&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, Mr. Whitaker, the man was seen when he
brought the canes here."</p>

<p>"Quite likely."</p>

<p>"And yet you say they are not here?"</p>

<p>"That is what I said. And what I still say."<a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a>"I don't understand&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I do not say they <i>were</i> not here. All I say is
that they <i>are</i> not here."</p>

<p>"They're gone? They've been taken away? Is
that what you mean?" demanded the astonished
sophomore.</p>

<p>"Precisely."</p>

<p>"Let's go in and search anyway," said one of the
party now thoroughly angry.</p>

<p>"I advise you not to attempt that," said the minister
quietly.</p>

<p>"Why not?" said the sophomore impudently.</p>

<p>"Because one of my neighbors is a deputy sheriff
and housebreaking is a somewhat serious offense."</p>

<p>For a moment the assembly was nonplussed, but
their uncertainty was speedily relieved, or at least
interrupted, by an occurrence that instantly caused
them all to turn and flee from the place at their
utmost speed.</p>

<h4>THE MYSTERY OF THE CANES</h4>


<p>At the very moment when the consternation of the
sophomores was keenest the sound of a sleigh turning
into the yard in which they were standing caused
them all to look quickly toward the gateway. The
ground was bare in places, and the runners of the
sleigh, as the iron bands passed over the gravel,
emitted shrieks and groans as if they were striving
to warn the sophomores of the impending peril.</p>

<p>Seated in the sleigh were three men whom the assembly
speedily recognized as members of the freshman
class, and their own fears for a moment doubtless
caused the sophomores to magnify the numbers
as well as the danger.</p>

<p>"Look out, fellows! Here they come!" said one
in a low voice whom Will and Hawley recognized.
It was Mott, who was again the spokesman and
leader of the little band.</p>

<p>"Let's get out of this," responded one whose voice
Will could not determine, and as if a sudden panic
had seized upon them the young men turned and began
to run swiftly.</p>

<p>"Hold on! Hold on, fellows!" called Mott savagely,
although his voice was not loud. "Hold on!
What are you running for? There are only three of
them, and we're good for any three freshmen in
Winthrop. Don't run. Come on back!"</p>

<p>Mott's appeal served to restore a measure of confidence
among his companions, and instantly the
flight was abandoned and all turned slowly back to<a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a>ward
the yard. Neither Will nor Hawley had yet
moved from his hiding-place, though they were leaning
farther out from the corner of the barn in their
eagerness to discover what was occurring in the yard
before them. They could see that the driver in the
sleigh was Foster, and he had leaped out and was
now as calmly tying his horse and fastening the
blanket upon it as if never a thought of his rival
class had entered his mind. Beside him two young
men were standing, but in the dim light it was impossible
to determine just who they were. The returning
sophomores were now near the new arrivals,
and the genial old minister could also be seen, still
standing on the piazza and evidently not uninterested
in the sight and presence of the young men before
him.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here, Bennett?" demanded
Mott of Foster.</p>

<p>"Oh, we're out for a sleigh ride," responded Foster
glibly, "and we just stopped here to see the fun.
What are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we stopped to see the fun too," responded
Mott gruffly. "It's worth going miles to see freshmen
who don't know any more than to go sleigh-riding
on bare ground. Had a good time, freshman?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Have you?"</p>

<p>"We're all right. If you've come for the canes
you're too late."</p>

<p>"Have you just found that out?" replied Foster
with a loud laugh. It was true that he was not
aware that the canes had been taken away, but he
<a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a>was not minded to betray his surprise to the members
of the rival class.</p>

<p>There was a brief interval of silence which was
broken by the old minister, who said, "I shall be
very glad, young gentlemen, to have you come into
the house. The night air is cold and you must be
thoroughly chilled. A little while ago I may have
appeared somewhat lacking in hospitality," he
added, turning to Mott as he spoke; "but now I can
assure you I shall be very glad indeed to receive you."</p>

<p>"Thank you," responded Foster. "We shall be
glad to come in if the others will come too."</p>

<p>"We can't very well to-night," said Mott glumly.
"We've got to go&mdash;"</p>

<p>Suddenly there broke in a wild yell upon the silence
of the night. The sound was made by only
two men, but these two were possessed of a lung
power that was well-nigh phenomenal. Hawley who
with his companion had been watching the events
that were occurring before them had suddenly
turned to Will and whispered, "Let's go in and take
a hand! Yell, Phelps! Make them hear you clear
over in Winthrop!"</p>

<p>"Hi-i-i-i!" the two lusty freshmen had shouted
together as they leaped forward, and the prolonged
yell was repeated when all the assembly had instantly
turned and for a moment in sheer astonishment were
gazing at the startling approach of men from behind
the barn.</p>

<p>"Come on, fellows!" shouted Hawley again.
"Come on! We'll get every one of them! Come
on! Come on!"<a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a>To the startled sophomores it seemed as if myriads
of their foes were rushing upon them, and after
a momentary confusion every one had started swiftly
across the narrow field that intervened between the
yard and the road that approached Coventry Center
from another direction.</p>

<p>"Come on, Foster! Come on all you fellows!"
shouted Hawley. "Come on! We'll get every soph
that's here and will put 'em where they won't do
any harm till long after St. Patrick's Day."</p>

<p>Obediently every freshman started to follow Hawley,
and across the rough, plowed field they ran
swiftly toward the road where the sophomores had
already disappeared from sight behind the bushes
that were thick and high by the roadside. When
once they had gained the road they could see the
forms of two men speeding away in the distance, and
with a renewed shout the freshmen started in swift
pursuit.</p>

<p>On up the long hill they sped until at last they
stood together on the summit. Not a sight of their
rivals was to be seen, and blankly the freshmen stood
and stared about them till Hawley said:</p>

<p>"No use, fellows. They've got away and we might
as well go back. Foster," he added, "did you know
the canes were gone?"</p>

<p>"Gone? Gone where?" replied Foster blankly.</p>

<p>"I haven't the slightest idea. All I know is that
Mr. Whitaker told Mott that the canes <i>had</i> been in
his house but they had been taken away."</p>

<p>"Who took them?"</p>

<p>"I haven't the slightest idea."<a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a>"You don't suppose the sophs got them, do you?"
said Foster hastily.</p>

<p>"I hadn't thought of that. It never entered my
mind that anybody but our own fellows had come for
them."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it was anybody else that got them,"
said Will. "You ought to have heard Mr. Whitaker
talk to Mott and the other sophs. They were just
determined to go into his house, but the old man
would not let them. No, you can rest easy about it,
Mr. Whitaker never let the canes go out of his house
without knowing who had come for them. No, sir.
Not much."</p>

<p>Somewhat comforted by Will's positiveness, the
boys began to retrace their way down the long road,
and after a moment Hawley said, "We'll find out all
about it anyway, for Mr. Whitaker will tell us. He's
all on our side. That's what comes of having his
grandson in our class. Say, fellows, you just ought
to have heard Mott rake over our class. He had the
nerve to stand there and tell Mr. Whitaker that we
were the worst lot that had ever entered Winthrop."</p>

<p>"I wish we had caught him!" said Foster warmly.
"We would have made him come up in his estimate
of the freshmen."</p>

<p>"Oh, he was just talking to hear himself," said
Will Phelps lightly. "He knows who we are all
right enough, and he isn't going to forget us right
away either. But I wish we had caught him."</p>

<p>"Here we are, fellows," said Hawley, as the five
young men clambered over the fence and once more
were in Mr. Whitaker's yard. "Let's go in and ask
him about it now."<a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a>"All right," responded Foster as they started toward
the door. "Hold on a minute. Let me take
a look at my horse first. I'll be with you in a
minute. Gre-a-at&mdash;" he suddenly began. "The
horse is gone!"</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed Will in astonishment.</p>

<p>No heed was given his expression, however, as
all five ran quickly to the post to which the horse
had been tied. But the horse and sleigh were gone,
and not a trace remained to show in which direction
they had departed.</p>

<p>"Sure you fastened him all right?" inquired Hawley
anxiously.</p>

<p>"I know I did," replied Foster.</p>

<p>"If you did then he couldn't have got loose. I
wonder if Mott and the sophs could have done it?
Come on! We'll go in and tell Mr. Whitaker and
he may be able to give us a point or two. There's
a light in the kitchen, and we'll probably find him
there. Come on, fellows!"</p>

<p>Hastily the boys ran to the kitchen door, and in response
to their knock Mr. Whitaker himself opened
the door and stood before them.</p>

<p>"Mr. Whitaker," began Foster, "do you know who
took our horse and sleigh?"</p>

<p>"Why! Why, I supposed that you did. Two
young men came into the yard not more than three
minutes ago and took them away."</p>

<p>"They did? Then it <i>was</i> the sophs," said Foster
turning to his comrades. "We'll never hear the last
of it. We can't get a horse here, can we, Mr. Whitaker?"
he inquired eagerly.<a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a>"I fear not. I have none of my own, and there
are not many to be had here anyway."</p>

<p>"Did they start toward Winthrop?"</p>

<p>"I think so. They turned toward the lower road."</p>

<p>"Let's get after them," suggested Foster.</p>

<p>"A long way after them," said Will grimly. "We
never could catch up with them."</p>

<p>"Mr. Whitaker," said Hawley, "how long ago
were the canes taken away from here?"</p>

<p>The good man hesitated, and the freshman without
waiting for him to speak began again. "We
belong to the same class as your grandson. We're
freshmen and we don't want the sophs to get those
canes."</p>

<p>"I regret exceedingly that I had anything to do
with it, but my grandson over-persuaded me and so
I consented. I should say that it was about an
hour ago when they came for the canes."</p>

<p>"Who came?"</p>

<p>"There were two young gentlemen, and they
brought me a note which informed me that I was to
let them take the canes away."</p>

<p>"A note?" demanded Hawley. "What did it say?
Who signed it?"</p>

<p>"It was signed by Hawley&mdash;Albert Hawley, if I
recollect aright, and also by my grandson."</p>

<p>"My name is Hawley and somebody forged it.
The sophs have the canes and I'm afraid it's too
late&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Too late nothing, Hawley!" said Will impulsively.
"What kind of a rig, I mean wagon or sleigh or
whatever it was, did they have?" he inquired of the
minister.<a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a>"It was a box wagon, a farm wagon, and they
had a farmer to drive for them."</p>

<p>"Did you know the man?" demanded Will.</p>

<p>"No. I cannot say that I did. He was a stranger
to me. But the note&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Probably some soph disguised as a farmer.
Did he have any other load in the wagon box?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I noticed some bags of meal."</p>

<p>"Good. And you say they took the lower road?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I recollect that distinctly."</p>

<p>"Isn't there a short cut? Can't we cut across lots
and head them off? They would have to go slow, and
it might be that we could head them somewhere and
get those canes away from them."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Mr. Whitaker. "I don't know that
I am doing right to tell you, but inasmuch as the
canes were secured by a forgery I shall certainly
tell you all I know of the matter. If you go down
to that little valley," and as he spoke he pointed in
a direction in the rear of the barn, "you will find a
pathway that leads beside the brook almost in a
straight line to what we call the ford. It saves
between three and four miles to Winthrop, and
whenever I walk I take the path. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thank you! Thank you, Mr. Whitaker! Come
on! We'll try it anyway, fellows. We've nothing to
lose and everything to gain. Good night, Mr.
Whitaker! Thank you for what you've told us,"
called Will Phelps, as he quickly turned and began
to run.</p>

<p>Obediently the boys all followed Will as he ran
swiftly across the field, and in a brief time they discovered
the pathway to which the old minister had
<a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a>referred. There was no conversation now, for the
fear in every heart was that they would arrive at the
ford too late to avail. Besides, there was the likelihood
that the canes would be disposed of before the
wagon had gone very far from Mr. Whitaker's house.
A multitude of fears possessed them, but they ran
swiftly along the path where Will Phelps, eager and
strong was leading the way. Not once did they stop
for rest. The night air was chilling, and the clouds
that swept across the face of the sky did not hide the
light of the moon.</p>

<p>On and on they sped, steadily maintaining the
dogged pace which the leader was setting for them,
until at last, well-nigh winded and thoroughly tired
by their exertions, they arrived at the place where
the pathway joined the road and they knew that
Winthrop was not more than three-quarters of a
mile away. There they halted, but they had not recovered
from the effects of their long run when they
perceived a farm wagon, apparently filled with bags,
coming down the hill that was near them.</p>

<h4>ON THE TRAIL</h4>


<p>As the eager freshmen peered out at the approaching
wagon the suppressed excitement threatened to
break all bounds. "Let's stop him and get the canes,"
suggested Hawley in a whisper.</p>

<p>"No. What'll be the good of that? It'll be better
to follow up the wagon quietly, and then if we
can find out where they put the canes, maybe a
little later we can get them away without the sophs
knowing anything about it. Don't you see we'll be
making it all the worse for them."</p>

<p>"We don't <i>know</i> that the canes are in the wagon,"
suggested Foster.</p>

<p>"Of course we don't, and it's all the same whether
we try to find out now or follow it up and find out a
little later."</p>

<p>"Phelps is right about it," said Hawley. "If the
canes shouldn't be found in the wagon, we would
be making fools of ourselves if we stopped it, but
if we let it go on and follow it up we'll be all the
better."</p>

<p>Meanwhile the wagon itself had passed the place
where the boys were concealed, and groaning and
creaking had begun the ascent of the opposite hill.
Only the driver was to be seen, and his appearance
and actions were unmistakable. He was a farmer
and well advanced in years, and if he was aware of
the contest that was being waged between the rival
<a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a>classes in Winthrop it was evident that he had no
share in the excitement.</p>

<p>"How'll we do it, fellows?" inquired Hawley anxiously.
"He'll get away before we get our eyes open,
if we don't look out."</p>

<p>"Let's follow him," said Will Phelps quickly.
"We mustn't go in a bunch, but string out. But we
mustn't be so far apart that we can't hear if one of
us calls or whistles."</p>

<p>"Come on, then," said Foster. "You go ahead,
Will, and we'll come along. You're a runner, and if
the old fellow begins to start up his horses you can
follow him better than any of us can. But we'll
have to do our best."</p>

<p>Quickly the suggestion was adopted, and Will ran
swiftly along the road until he discovered the wagon
not far in advance of him. It was moving at the
same monotonous pace as when it had passed the
hiding place of the boys. Will Phelps, when he
came within a hundred yards of the wagon he was
following, decreased his own speed and endeavored
to keep close to the fences by the roadside, so that
he would not be seen by the driver if he should
chance to look behind him.</p>

<p>They were soon within sight of Winthrop, and
the shadowy towers of the college buildings could
be discerned in the distance. It was long past midnight,
and the only lights that could be seen were
those of the twinkling stars and the occasional flash
of the moonlight when the broken clouds that were
moving across the face of the sky parted sufficiently
for the face of the moon to be seen.</p>

<p>Suddenly Will was aware that the wagon had
<a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a>stopped at a corner where a road or street that led
to the lower part of the village joined the road
that led past the college buildings. He darted behind
a huge tree that grew close to the roadside, and
eagerly peered forth to discover what the next
move of the farmer would be. He could see that
some one approached the wagon, and after a brief
delay climbed up on the seat beside the driver and
then the team started on once more. Will was keenly
excited by this time, and his suspicions were confirmed
that the canes were indeed in the wagon before
him. He was eager to follow swiftly, but he
quickly decided that it would be wiser to wait until
Hawley came up to the place where he himself was
waiting and explain to him the change in the direction
of the party they were following.</p>

<p>The huge form of Hawley soon appeared, and impatiently
Will ran out into the road to meet him.
"They've turned in here," he said excitedly, "and
you must stop here and tell the fellows. I'll run
on ahead and find out where the wagon goes."</p>

<p>Quickly Will darted across the fields and soon
came into the lower road. The wagon could be seen
not far in advance of him, and was still moving at
a slow pace from which it had not varied since it
first had been seen. It was evident that the sophs
were either indifferent or absolutely confident, Will
could not determine which. For a moment his
heart misgave him. What a plight he would be in if
it should appear that he and his classmates had been
following a purposely designed trick of their rivals.
The thought was by no means reassuring, but there
was no time afforded for reflection, for the wagon
<a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a>he was following even then turned into a lane that
led to a farmhouse and barns that were not far
from the road. The climax had almost been reached
and it would be soon known what the issue was to
be.</p>

<p>Will waited now for his classmates to join him.
The wagon could not escape, for the lane came to
an abrupt end in the yard, and if it should turn back
it could not pass the place where he was waiting
without being seen.</p>

<p>It was not long before Hawley joined him, and,
as he approached, Will said: "They've gone down
this lane. Somebody was waiting here and has gone
with the driver. There may be a good many others
down there by the barn for all that we know. What
do you think we'd better do?"</p>

<p>"There's a haystack out there by the barn," said
Hawley, pointing to a stack of some kind that could
be seen in the rear of the nearest barn. "If you could
only get behind that you could see what was going
on."</p>

<p>"I can, all right enough. But where will you fellows
be? I may need your help if I get into trouble."</p>

<p>"I don't know. We won't be far away. Whistle
if you want us and we'll make a break for you.
Don't let them see you," he added warningly, as
without waiting to reply, Will started at once, running
swiftly along the ground near the crooked
rail fence that extended the entire distance between
the main road and the farm buildings.</p>

<p>He was convinced that he had not been seen when
<a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a>at last he gained the shelter of the haystack, and,
crouching within its shadows, he peered forth at
the wagon and the group of four men that were
standing near it. He was positive that one was
Mott, but his greatest surprise came when he perceived
a horse and sleigh in the barnyard which he
instantly recognized as the very ones with which
Foster and his two classmates had gone to Coventry
Center. He reached forward and strove to hear
what was being said, for the little group were conversing
eagerly but in tones so low that Will was
unable to hear a word. He could see what was done,
however, for after a brief delay the four men turned
to the wagon, several sacks were lifted from their
places in the load, and then two other sacks were
taken from the wagon and carried by Mott and another
man into the barn. Several minutes elapsed
before Mott came forth again, and when he did
he was alone. The sophomore stopped for a moment
with the men, handed some money to the
farmer, and then he and the fourth man, whom
Will fancied he recognized as another sophomore,
climbed into the sleigh and at once started back up
the lane, the runners of the sleigh screeching as
they passed over the bare places as if they were
doing their utmost to alarm the neighborhood and
to protest against what was being done. The farmer
too, soon followed and passed up the lane, but his
departure was of slight interest to Will, who was
puzzling himself about the man who had entered
the barn with Mott and had failed to reappear.
To Will's mind there was but one explanation, and
he was eager to confer with his own classmates, but
<a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a>he dared not leave his hiding-place for fear that
the man in the barn might come forth and depart
without being seen.</p>

<p>For a half-hour he waited but the stillness of the
night was unbroken. He was becoming chilled and
he dared not remain longer where he was. At last
he decided to return to the place where he had
left his own classmates and report to them what he
had seen.</p>

<p>Hastily withdrawing from his shelter he ran
swiftly across the fields until he came to the corner,
and then whistling softly was rejoiced when he perceived
his friends rise from the ground in an angle
of the crooked fence and advance to meet him.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Will?" said Foster in a low voice.
"We didn't know what had become of you. What's
up? What's wrong?"</p>

<p>Will hastily described what he had seen and then
said, "I'm dead sure, fellows, that that soph has
been left in the barn to watch those canes."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you run away with the horse and
sleigh?" inquired Hawley.</p>

<p>"I did think of trying it. But I made up my
mind that even if I should succeed in doing it, it
would give the whole thing away. They'd know
that we'd found out where they had hidden our
canes and there wouldn't be much use in our trying
to get them again. Now we know where they are
and the sophs don't even know that we know."</p>

<p>"You mean you think they don't know that we
know," suggested Foster.<a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a>"I know it!" asserted Will positively. "Now
what shall we do?"</p>

<p>"Put straight back to the barn, tie up the soph
and take the canes away with us," said Hawley
promptly.</p>

<p>"I've thought of that," replied Will. "But do
you think that's the best plan? If we take the
canes away we may lose them, for St. Patrick's Day
isn't till day after to-morrow, you know. If this
soph, I don't know who he is, has been left as
guard he'll be relieved, and if they find he's gone
and the canes too, why it'll be all the harder for
us."</p>

<p>"What do you suggest, Phelps?" inquired Hawley.</p>

<p>"How will this do? Some one of us can creep
back there into the barn and keep watch the same
as the soph is doing. He can be relieved in the
morning and then some one else can take his place.
If anything happens in the barn he'll be pretty
likely to know it, and if anything doesn't happen
then we can get up a good-sized crowd and go down
there to-morrow night and get the canes. We can
distribute them among our fellows and then the
next morning every fellow in the class can march
into chapel with his cane."</p>

<p>"Good! Good! That's the idea!" said Hawley
warmly. "Who'll go down in the barn and be guard
for the night?"</p>

<p>"Who's got the most cuts to spare?" inquired Will.</p>

<p>"I have," said Foster promptly. "I have taken
but four."<a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a>"Then I should say you were the one to stand
guard to-morrow," said Will. "I'll go to-night myself,"
he added. "Come down just before it's light
in the morning, and come to the door in the rear of
the barn. Rap three times softly, and then if that
doesn't work, whistle, but not too loud."</p>

<p>There was some demurring on the part of his
classmates, each of whom demanded for himself
the privilege of taking the first watch, but Will insisted,
and then somewhat reluctantly he was left
to make his way back to the barn and all the others
soon returned to the dormitories.</p>

<p>When Will Phelps arrived at the rear door of the
barn he discovered that it was locked on the inside
and he was unable to gain an entrance there. He
was fearful that to enter by the front door would
be but to proclaim his presence, but at last he perceived
that there was an entrance by a small door
that was partly open above the roof of the little
lean-to on the side of the barn. Carefully he climbed
up on the roof and cautiously made his way to the
door. He peered within but it was dark and at first
he was unable to discern anything. He waited until
his eyes became somewhat accustomed to the
dim light and then saw that there was a bare
floor before him and that adjoining it was the
haymow.</p>

<p>With his utmost care he stepped inside, and his
fears increased when he discovered that the loose
flooring creaked and groaned beneath his feet. With
every step he halted and listened intently. It seemed
to the excited freshman that he never had heard
<a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a>such sounds as those boards emitted that night. So
slowly and cautiously did he proceed that it seemed
to him that hours must have elapsed before he
succeeded in gaining the border of the low mow.
Even then he halted and listened intently, but not
a sound broke in upon the oppressive stillness that
pervaded the barn.</p>

<p>He next carefully and cautiously stepped over into
the mow. A faint glimmer of light came from one
corner and there he concluded the ladder must be
which led to the floor below. If he could gain a
place near that, he assured himself he would be able
to know if anything occurred below, and at the
same time he himself would be secure from observation.</p>

<p>Once more he slowly and with the utmost care
began to creep forward, and at last he stretched
himself at full length upon the hay and peered down
through the opening. It was too dark to permit
him to see much and not a sound could be heard.</p>

<p>Satisfied that he had been successful he resigned
himself to his watch. The long hours dragged on
until at last Will found it almost impossible to keep
himself awake. Desperately he strove to keep his
eyes open, but his feeling of drowsiness increased
until at last it overpowered him and the weary
freshman was fast asleep.</p>

<p>He was rudely awakened by sounds that came
from the room below. He sat quickly erect, and
though the light was clearer now he at first could
not collect his thoughts sufficiently to show him
where he was. Quickly, however, as the sounds from
<a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a>below became louder, it all came back to him, and
he ran to the ladder and peered through the opening.
What he saw evidently startled him, for instantly
he threw himself upon the ladder and almost
leaped to the floor below.</p>

<h4>ST. PATRICK'S DAY</h4>


<p>The door in the rear of the barn was open and on
the floor before it stood Foster and Mott facing
each other. Whether or not the sophomore who had
been left as a guard was still in the barn Will could
not determine, but, without waiting to find out, he
almost leaped to the floor below, and before Mott
could recover from his surprise he was helpless
in the hands of his enemies. It was but the work
of a moment securely to bind his hands and feet, and
the leading spirit of the sophomore class was soon
a helpless captive.</p>

<p>Excited though the boys were, the entire adventure
was completed in a very brief time, and Will
and Foster were both laughing when they gazed at
their helpless prisoner. Even Mott smiled as he
said ruefully:</p>

<p>"You've scored, freshmen. What are you going
to do with me?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Will quickly.</p>

<p>Mott drew down the corners of his mouth and
then a sudden light appeared in his eyes that caused
Will to look keenly at him for a moment. "Come
on, Foster," he said simply; "let's put this fellow
where he won't do any more harm, at least until
after St. Patrick's Day."</p>

<p>"Where'll we put him?" inquired Foster.</p>

<p>Will turned and looked about him and perceived a
small harness room on the ground floor near him,
<a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a>and upon his suggestion the helpless sophomore was
placed within it for safe keeping.</p>

<p>"Now then, Foster," said Will when he had closed
the door of the room, "we've just got to find the
place where these canes are hidden. Mott has come
here to take the place of the guard that was here
last night and nobody knows how long it'll be before
some one else comes. Come on, let's get about
it."</p>

<p>At once the two freshmen began their search. Beginning
near the entrance, they examined every bin
and peered into every possible place of concealment.
Even in the mangers before which the horses were
tied they peered and searched, but when they had
carefully examined the entire floor they had not
been able to discover the place where the coveted
canes had been concealed.</p>

<p>"What are we to do, Will?" demanded Foster at
last.</p>

<p>"Let's ask Mott."</p>

<p>"He'll never let on."</p>

<p>"Try it, anyway."</p>

<p>The two boys returned to the harness room and
Will at once addressed their prisoner.</p>

<p>"Mott," he said, "where are those canes?"</p>

<p>The sophomore laughed loudly as he replied, "You
certainly are the two most innocent freshmen I have
ever struck yet. Perhaps you'd like to have me help
you carry them back to the college."</p>

<p>"We'll let you go if you'll tell us where they are."</p>

<p>"Thanks muchly," replied Mott dryly.<a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a>"Come on, Will," said Foster. "We can find them
ourselves. No use in wasting time here with this
fellow. We'll get them ourselves."</p>

<p>"You're certain they're here?" laughed Mott.</p>

<p>Neither responded to his question, but both left
the room and resumed their search.</p>

<p>"You don't suppose they have really got those
canes somewhere else, do you, Foster? They might
be just trying to put us on the wrong track here, you
know?" inquired Will.</p>

<p>"It's possible, but I don't believe it," said Foster
positively. "If that was their game Mott wouldn't
be here."</p>

<p>"Probably not," assented Will. "Let's begin
again. We've no time to waste."</p>

<p>The freshmen now began to search in the loft
of the barn. They seized the pitchforks that were
in the mow, and, thrusting the tines into the hay,
they continued their search, working with desperate
determination and throwing the hay about them until
the entire mow presented the appearance of
having been almost completely overturned.</p>

<p>But not a trace of the missing canes could they
discover. At last, satisfied that their efforts were
vain, they ceased and for a moment stared blankly
at each other.</p>

<p>"No use," said Will despondently. "They've made
game of us this time, Foster, just as sure as you
live."</p>

<p>"We won't give up yet, Will. Of course if the
canes are here they were not put where we'd be
<a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a>likely to stumble over them. We've just got to
think it out&mdash;"</p>

<p>Foster stopped abruptly as a voice was heard calling
up from below. "I must bid you an affectionate
and tearful farewell, freshmen. Keep on with
your good work and remember that perseverance
conquers everything. Even the best of friends must
part&mdash;"</p>

<p>Foster and Will waited to hear no more, but both
plunged down the ladder, but when they had gained
the floor below it was to behold Mott speeding up
the lane as if he was "sprinting" for life itself. For
a moment the surprise and consternation of the
two freshmen were so complete that both were
speechless.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you take after him, Will?" said Foster,
who was the first to break in upon the awkward
silence. "What are you standing here for?"</p>

<p>"No use, Foster," replied Will, shaking his head.
"He's got too good a start. I don't see how he ever
got loose."</p>

<p>"Well, he is loose and that's all there is about it.
What'll we do next?"</p>

<p>"Find those canes. They're here, I know they
are."</p>

<p>"Just tell me where they are, will you?"</p>

<p>"They won't come to us, that's certain! We've
got to look them up. And if we don't find them
pretty soon too it'll be the worse for us."</p>

<p>Will turned as he spoke and once more opened
the lid of a piano box that was standing on the floor
near them. The box apparently was filled with
<a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a>oats and they had inspected it before, but as it had
not presented any appearance of containing the
object of their search they had passed it by and gone
on to the loft above.</p>

<p>This time, however, Will thrust his arm deep
down into the oats and in a moment he almost
shouted. "Here's something, Foster! Help me clear
away these oats. There's something down in there!"</p>

<p>Foster seized the scoop that was near the improvised
oat bin and with feverish haste threw the oats
up on one side and then said exultantly, "Here's
something! Here they are!"</p>

<p>Leaning over the box, he drew forth a bundle of
canes carefully tied together and partly hidden from
sight beneath the oats.</p>

<p>"Are they all there?" demanded Will in a hoarse
whisper. He hastily inspected the bundle and then
exclaimed, "Here's only a part of them, Foster!"</p>

<p>"Where some are it's likely there are more," and
Will at once resumed his search. His efforts were
speedily rewarded by the discovery of another bundle
similar to the one that had already been found,
and, dropping his scoop, he hastily began to count
the canes.</p>

<p>"Here they are!" he exclaimed joyfully. "Every
last one of them is here!"</p>

<p>"Then the sophs must have been to both places
where we had them."</p>

<p>"Yes, but it's all the better for us. We'll now
be&mdash;"</p>

<p>Foster stopped abruptly as the farmer that owned
<a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a>the buildings appeared in the doorway and for a
moment stared blankly at them.</p>

<p>"Good morning," said Will cheerfully. "We're
here after these canes."</p>

<p>"So I see," replied the farmer. "The freshmans
didn't find ye out, then?"</p>

<p>"It's all right," responded Will glibly. "How
much are we to pay you?"</p>

<p>"They paid me last night. I guess 'twas 'beout
right. I don't want nothin' more."</p>

<p>"We've tumbled your hay over more than we
thought," said Will, as he thrust a bill into the man's
hand.</p>

<p>"I don't know 'beout it," drawled the farmer,
nevertheless thrusting the money into his pocket.
"Putty good pay, but I don't know but I might's
well take it."</p>

<p>"Of course you're to take it!" said Will eagerly.
"All we ask of you now is not to tell anybody&mdash;anybody,"
he added with special emphasis, "that
we've taken the canes away. Don't tell any one of
it or the whole game will be spoiled."</p>

<p>"I'll be as mum as a hitchin' post."</p>

<p>Without waiting for any further words the two
boys seized the bundles and at once departed from
the barn. When they came out into the lane they
looked carefully about them in every direction, but
no one could be seen and they soon came out into
the open road.</p>

<p>"What are we going to do with them now?" inquired
Foster, as they halted for a moment.<a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a>"We can't take them back to our rooms," said
Will.</p>

<p>"No! No! That would never do."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you," said Will quickly. "Let's take them
down to that old bridge yonder," pointing as he
spoke toward a rude bridge that spanned the stream
not far away.</p>

<p>"All right. Come along, then," responded Foster.</p>

<p>Instantly the two boys began to run and in a
brief time arrived at the rude structure, and after a
hasty inspection they placed the two bundles on the
piers beneath the bridge and then covered them
with the driftwood that had been cast up on the
bank of the stream when its waters had been swelled
by the passing storms.</p>

<p>When their work was at last completed they departed
for Winthrop and arrived just as the final
strokes of the bell were given that assembled the
students in the chapel. They hastily passed in with
the throng of students and were in their seats in
time to receive credit for attendance.</p>

<p>As they passed out from the chapel when the
service was ended they came face to face with Mott
and a group of sophomores, who evidently were
waiting for their appearance; but as neither Foster
nor Will betrayed any emotion by the expression
upon their faces it was impossible for the sophomores
to perceive whether or not the canes had been
discovered.</p>

<p>There was no question about their opinions, however,
when later in the day it was apparent that
the sophomore class was possessed of a feeling of
<a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a>intense excitement. Parties were sent forth in
various directions, and there was the keenest interest
manifest in the entire college. Will and Foster,
however, were too wise to relate their experiences
to any except to the three or four leaders of
their class; and when night fell, by a circuitous
route, and then only after a half-dozen parties had
been sent out in other directions to mislead any
of their rivals who might be watching their movements,
they proceeded to the bridge, secured the
canes, and bringing them safely back to the college
under the protecting shelter of the darkness, distributed
them among the members of the class.</p>

<p>Great was the elation of the freshmen when on
the following morning they formed in a body near
the gymnasium just before the hour of morning
prayers in the chapel and then marched to the
service every one carrying in his hands one of the
coveted sticks.</p>

<p>The discomfited sophomores endured in silence the
gibes of the students, and the exultant freshmen received
the applause that greeted their success with
an air that it is to be feared only served to increase
the chagrin of their rivals. And Will Phelps and
Foster were at once, and by a common though unspoken
assent, awarded a place among the leaders
of their class for their success.</p>

<p>Of the parade that took place that day Will Phelps
did not tire of talking for many a week. The assembled
crowd of students, townspeople, and visitors,
the long line of freshmen in the parade and
their grotesque appearance, the stirring music of a
<a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a>brass band at the head of the line, the march to
the lower campus where the huge bonfire was kindled,
the weird songs and dancing as in dual lines
the two lower classes with joined hands leaped and
danced about the blazing fire, and then the final
consignment to the flames of the huge wooden
hatchet that had been carried in the parade, were
all incidents that duly impressed him. And when at
last the fires burned low and the final song was
sung, and it was declared that the hatchet was
buried forever and all feelings of animosity between
the lower classmen were at an end, the boys
returned to their rooms feeling that a well-earned
victory had been won.</p>

<p>The escapades were doubtless silly, and in after
years brought a smile to the faces of the participants
when they were then recalled, but nevertheless
they had formed a part of the experiences of
college life and had brought with them the development
of certain qualities of leadership which in
other ways and in later days were to play no small
part in the lives of Will Phelps and his room-mate.</p>

<p>The coming of springtime in Winthrop was always
an occasion of general rejoicing. The hills were
once more covered with their garments of green and
the valleys were beautiful in their verdure. Among
the students at Winthrop there was usually a relaxing
of effort then, but Will Phelps, though the
effort cost him much, still held himself resolutely
to his tasks. He had been learning not merely
what to study but also how to study, and in his
spring vacation his father had explained to him
that this was his supreme purpose and desire. If
<a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a>a man did not learn how to work while he was a
student in college it was seldom the case that he
learned it afterward. And Will had responded. His
Greek was still distasteful to him, but he was doing
somewhat better and was more content.</p>

<p>The crowning ambition in Will's heart as we know
was to secure a place on the college track team.
And he had been working quietly yet persistently
under the guidance of Wagner for the desired end.
At last, early in May, came the trial meets of the
college when the selections for the team were to
be made, and when Will donned his running suit
and went down to the track to all appearances he
was calmer than his room-mate. But in his heart
there was a feeling such as he had never known
before.</p>

<h4>CONCLUSION</h4>


<p>It was a noisy crowd of students that assembled
at the Winthrop athletic field on that day early in
May when the trials for the track team were to be
held. Keen as was the interest in baseball the interest
in the track team was even keener, for hope
was high among the students that a championship
team would be turned out and the competition
among the eight colleges that composed the league
was at fever heat. The most formidable rival of
Winthrop was Alden, and, as within the past four
years each of the two colleges had won the championship
twice, the coming contest would decide the
possession of the cup which the association had voted
should be held in the permanent possession of the
college which had won most of the meets within the
limits of the five years.</p>

<p>Will Phelps was keenly excited although his movements
were very deliberate as he walked about the
field clad in his running suit, over which he was
wearing his bath robe. His desire to secure a place
on the team was so strong that he hardly dared
face the possibility of a failure. The disappointments
of the year would in a measure be atoned for
if only he might win the coveted honor. He had
carefully followed the instructions of Wagner, the
captain of the team, who though, by his physician's
orders was not to compete, was nevertheless deeply
interested and for some reason had taken an especially
strong liking to Will Phelps. Upon his ad<a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a>vice
Will had retired early the preceding night and
had secured a rest that made him now feel that if
ever he was to win, the present opportunity was the
supreme one.</p>

<p>"Don't do your best in the heats, unless you have
to," said Wagner as he approached Will on the field
and stopped for a moment to chat with him. "Save
your strength for the finals."</p>

<p>Will smiled but did not reply. In his present
state of mind he was wondering if he could run at
any pace that was not his best. The events were
being run off now and he was striving to become
interested in them. Anything that would call his
thoughts away from himself and his own contest
was to be desired, he thought. Foster had tried and
failed to win a place and Peter John Schenck too
had not been successful. Was his own chance better
than theirs? He could hardly believe that it
was, and yet if determination could aid he knew
that his lack, if he should be found wanting, would
not be due to that cause.</p>

<p>At last the supreme moment arrived and the call
for the first heat in the hundred yards dash was
heard. Will's heart was beating furiously when he
cast aside his bath robe and tossed it to Foster
who was waiting to receive it. His room-mate
smiled encouragingly but was too wise to speak and
Will advanced to the line. He perceived that three
others were with him in the heat, but Mott, whom
he most feared, was not among the number. That
was a source of some consolation, and his hope increased
that he might at least win a place in the
finals.<a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a>As the pistol was fired, Will darted forward from
the line, but in a moment the runners were recalled
and Will was penalized a yard for his undue eagerness.
Grimly he took his place this time a yard behind
the line and when the start was again made
he sped down the track as if he was possessed of the
speed of the wind. Easily he was the first to touch
the tape, but when unmindful of the cheers of his
classmates he turned aside to don once more his
bath robe, Wagner approached and shaking his head,
laughed as he said, "You forgot what I told you,
freshman."</p>

<p>"What was that?"</p>

<p>"Not to run your best in the heat. You want
something left for the finals."</p>

<p>"I couldn't help it," said Will grimly. "What was
the time?"</p>

<p>"Ten, two."</p>

<p>Nothing more was said as they all turned to
watch the runners in the other heats. Mott with
apparent ease won his, and Ogden won the third.
The final was to be run off between the three winners
and Will stretched himself upon the grass to
gain such rest as he could obtain before the supreme
test arrived.</p>

<p>Other events were now run off and a half-hour
elapsed before the final heat was called. "You'll get
your place on the team anyway, Will," said Foster
encouragingly.</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure of that."</p>

<p>"I am. I heard Wagner say that three would be
<a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a>taken on the team for the sprints, and even if you
come in last you'll be sure of a place."</p>

<p>"I don't know. I don't want to come in last."</p>

<p>"Don't, then," laughed Foster as he reached forth
his hand for his room-mate's bath robe. Once more
Will stood on the line and this time there would be
no "sneaking," he assured himself. Somehow the
keenness of his previous excitement was gone now
and he was almost as calm as if he had been a
spectator and not a participant in the contest. He
was none the less resolved to do his utmost and
when the pistol at last was fired he leaped from
the mark with every nerve and muscle tense. A
silence rested over all as the three runners came
swiftly up the track. Will could feel rather than see
that he was ahead of Ogden, but Mott was still in
advance of him, and do what he might he did not
seem to be able to cut down that yard by which Mott
was leading. Swiftly the racers sped on and soon
Will could see that the end of the course had almost
been gained. Only fifteen yards remained to be
covered, and then by one supreme effort Will called
upon all his reserve powers and with what the college
paper afterward described as a "magnificent
burst of speed," he cut down Mott's lead and a moment
later the two runners struck the tape exactly
together.</p>

<p>A mighty shout arose from the assembled students
and Foster and Hawley both of whom were usually
so self-contained ran out and threw their arms about
the neck of their classmate. The enthusiasm increased
when the time was announced as "ten, one."<a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a>
and Wagner came forward his face beaming and his
hand outstretched as he said: "You did it, freshman!
I knew you could, and I knew you would."</p>

<p>Words of praise had never sounded sweeter in
Will's ears. He had won a place on the team and
that coveted honor at least was his.</p>

<p>His interest in the trials was mostly ended now
and he returned to the dressing rooms, where he
donned his ordinary garb and then rejoined his fellows.
Their congratulations were sweet in his ears
and the very appearance of the beautiful valley to
him seemed to have changed. He had won and the
stimulus of success was his.</p>

<p>In the month that followed Will found himself
excessively busy. He took his meals now with the
team at the training table and every day there was
work to be done on the track. And it was hard
work too. But the demands were almost forgotten
in the elation which filled the heart of the young
student. His father's warm words of congratulation
were prized most of all, but Will felt that he
did not require the caution which his father gave
him not to permit his success in athletics to interfere
with his work for the classroom. Even "Splinter's"
demands had lost a part of their unreasonableness,
or so it seemed to Will, and even the detested
Greek could be mastered under the glow of success
that was his.</p>

<p>At last the eventful day arrived when the meet
between the colleges was to be held. Will had worked
so hard and so faithfully that he was not without
hopes of winning some points for his college and he
<a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a>was aware how much they were needed and how
eager all the student body was that the cup might
come to Winthrop. Mott was the only one who had
appeared to be at all envious of him, but as Will had
heard that the sophomore had been careless in his
training and there had been reports that Mott and
Peter John had been drinking heavily again, he felt
that he could well afford to ignore the slights. And
in his heart he knew that he was sincere when he
declared to himself that if he could not win he heartily
wished that Mott might, for Winthrop would be
the gainer in either event.</p>

<p>The team had been taken to the city where the
meet was to be held, on the day preceding the contest,
and that night at the hotel Will endeavored
again to follow the advice of Wagner and secure a
good sleep. But his excitement and the novelty of
his surroundings and thoughts of the impending
meet were too keen to be entirely overcome by the
young freshman, and on the following morning
his heart was somewhat heavy and his fears increased.</p>

<p>When at last the hour arrived when the team, in a
huge coach, was taken to the field, a measure of calm
had returned to him and as he looked out over the
great assembly his interest became intense. Students
from the various colleges had been assigned
sections in the bleachers and streamers and banners
with the huge initial letter of the college emblazoned
upon them were much in evidence. The
colors of the competing colleges were also to be
seen among the spectators and with shouts and
cheers and songs to be heard on every side Will felt
<a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a>that this was the supreme moment of his life. He
stood gazing at the inspiring sight until he felt a
touch on his shoulder that caused him quickly to
turn about.</p>

<p>"Why, pop!" he exclaimed delightedly as he perceived
who it was that had touched him. "I didn't
have the remotest idea that you were here."</p>

<p>"I had to come to see what my boy would do,"
replied Mr. Phelps quietly.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you won't see much."</p>

<p>"I shall see him do his best, and that's worth the
trip."</p>

<p>"Come on, freshman!" interrupted Mott approaching.
"It's time to dress."</p>

<p>Will grasped his father's hand for a moment and
then hastened to follow the other members of the
Winthrop team who were making their way to their
quarters.</p>

<p>"Alden is going to win all the sprints," said Mott
glumly while they were dressing.</p>

<p>"If they're the best runners they will," assented
Will who despite his eagerness was now in good
spirits.</p>

<p>"Wagner has figured it out and says if they do win
the sprints they'll take the cup."</p>

<p>Will made no response though he knew that if
Wagner had indeed said that, then the college would
look to Mott and to himself to do their best. No
praise would be too high if they should succeed, and
no blame too severe if they should fail. And his
own determination and desire to win for a moment
<a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a>faltered. What could he in his first great contest
hope to do?</p>

<p>The appearance of the team on the field was greeted
by a wild shout from the Winthrop contingent.
The team was cheered and every member of it also
was cheered by name. The entire scene was certainly
inspiring and Will's determination returned
more strongly than before. The first event was the
four hundred and forty yard dash in which Alden
received first and Winthrop second. In the one
hundred and twenty yard hurdles the order was reversed,
and so the record continued through the
two-twenty, the two-twenty hurdles, the eight hundred
and eighty yards run. The field events were
also being carried out at the same time and with
very similar results. Alden was second in the shot
put and Winthrop second in the running high jump
while neither scored in throwing the hammer nor
in the running broad jump. But again Winthrop
was first in throwing the discus, but Alden was
first in the pole vault; and so the points scored by
each of the two rivals remained the same when at
last came the trials in the hundred yards dash,
which as we know was the event in which Will
Phelps and Mott were entered. The color had
fled from Will's face and he was hardly conscious
of the shouts or presence of the great assembly
when he advanced to the line, for he was to run in
the first heat. Thirty-two men were entered for
the race and there were to be six heats, only the
winners in each to qualify for the finals.</p>

<p>"You've nobody to fear here," whispered Wagner
encouragingly. "Take it easy."<a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a>"I'll have to come in first if I get in the finals."</p>

<p>"Yes, but you can do it all right."</p>

<p>Wagner slipped back and the seven young men
took their places on the line. When the pistol was
fired Will darted forward and held the lead all the
way, touching the tape first of all.</p>

<p>Wagner again was there to receive him and as
Will fell into his arms he turned quickly and said.
"What was the time?"</p>

<p>"They'll announce it in a minute," replied Wagner
compelling his friend to don his robe. When the
time was announced as "ten three," Will's heart
sank, but Wagner laughed gleefully as he said,
"Good! That's the way to do it. You've got some
reserve left."</p>

<p>Will Phelps was not so confident, but he turned
eagerly to watch the other contestants. Mott won
his heat in ten two, each of two heats was won by
an Alden man in the same time, and the fifth heat
was won by a man from a smaller college of whom
no one expected much and who was but slightly
feared.</p>

<p>The mile run, the two mile run, and the half-mile
were run off while the sprinters were waiting for
their finals and the excitement became intense when
it was known that the score of Winthrop and Alden
was exactly the same. Everything now depended
upon the result of the finals in the hundred yards
dash.</p>

<p>"Phelps, you <i>must</i> get it!" whispered Wagner
whose face was as pale as that of the freshman. Will
<a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a>did not reply and at once took his place beside his
four competitors.</p>

<p>"On your marks!" called the starter, and the
silence that rested over the field became intense.</p>

<p>"Get set!" A sigh seemed to rise from the assembly
and all were standing.</p>

<p>"Go!" The crack of the pistol was heard and instantly
the runners were speeding down the track.</p>

<p>The day was warm and Will Phelps could feel
that his face was as wet as if he had plunged in the
river. Never in all his young life had he exerted
himself as then. The tread of the running feet on
the track seemed almost like that of one man. On
and on they sped, no one looking to the right or left.
Whether he was winning or not, Will was unable to
determine. He knew that all five were "bunched,"
for he could feel and hear the others near him. The
deafening shouts and the shrill calls and cries sounded
faint and dim in his ears. He could see the officials
standing near the end of the course&mdash;an end
that seemed far away for all that the runners were
so swiftly approaching.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer the runners drew and the
shouts increased in violence. Every one in the assembly
was standing erect and leaning forward,
breathless with interest. Fifteen, ten, then only
five yards remained. With one supreme effort Will
darted ahead. He felt the tape, and not knowing
whether he had won or not he plunged into the
outstretched arms of Wagner.</p>

<p>For a moment everything was dim about him and
there was a sound as of a roaring in his ears. Then
<a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a>above the din he heard the wild shout of the Winthrop
boys and he heard Wagner say, "The cup's
ours, Phelps! We've got it! We've won it!"</p>

<p>"Was I first?" inquired Will simply.</p>

<p>"No, second."</p>

<p>"I don't see then. Who did win?"</p>

<p>"Crafts from Tech was first and you were second
and the Alden man third," said Wagner hilariously.
"You put us two points ahead of Alden!
You've won your 'W' and we've got the cup!"</p>

<p>Before Will could respond a body of the Winthrop
boys made a rush upon him and lifting him
upon their shoulders advanced to the middle of the
field followed by the entire body of their fellow-students.
Then in fantastic steps and winding column
they marched about the field, singing their college
songs and uniting in their college yell for the
team and for Phelps again and again. The interested
spectators stopped and watched the proceedings
until at last the team returned to their dressing
rooms and the day was done.</p>

<p>On the return to Winthrop Will was seated beside
his father, and as they drew near the college
town Mr. Phelps, who was not to stop, but was at
once going home, said: "Well, Will, what of the
year? It's done now."</p>

<p>"Yes," responded Will simply. "It's not been so
bad."</p>

<p>"What about the Greek?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Splinter's not half-bad either," laughed Will.
"I think I'll go down and see him before I come
home."<a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a>"I should. And you're not sorry that you didn't
give up to Greek?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit."</p>

<p>"And you think winning the 'hundred' to-day is
worth it all?"</p>

<p>"It isn't that. It's the feeling that I haven't
given up. Of course I'm glad to get my 'W' and I
was mighty sorry not to get my numerals. But this
makes up for it. I'm glad I won out for myself
and more for the college. I tell you, pop, Winthrop
is the best college in the world!"</p>

<p>"And you wouldn't like to leave now?"</p>

<p>"Leave? Well, I guess not!"</p>

<p>"I hear that Peter John is not to come back," said
Mr. Phelps soberly.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I can't say. I don't even know that he is not to
return. I have heard it, that's all; but I fancy you
know more about it than I."</p>

<p>Will was silent till the train was near Winthrop.
"Well, Will," said his father, breaking in, "I'm to
leave you here. Do you want to know what I value
most in your year's work?"</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"That you've learned how to work. When a man
learns that, much of the problem of his life is solved.
Some men run from hardness, some endure it, and
some overcome it."</p>

<p>"It hasn't been so hard."</p>

<p>Mr. Phelps smiled but all he said was, "Good-bye,<a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a>
Will, we'll look for you soon at home. I think
you've made a good investment this year."</p>

<p>"In what?" inquired Will in surprise.</p>

<p>But his father only smiled and grasped his son's
hand for a moment and soon the train pulled out
from the little station; but as long as the crowd of
students, noisy, boisterous, happy, could be seen as
they moved up the street he watched them with
shining eyes. Then as he resumed his seat he
thoughtfully said to himself, "Yes, Will has learned
it. I did not know for a time whether he would or
not. But he has and I don't think Splinter, or Mott,
or Peter John, or anything, or any one can take
it away from him now."</p>

<p>And he resumed the reading of his evening paper,
while the noisy train sped on bearing him farther
and farther from Winthrop, but the Winthrop college
boy was nearer to him all the time.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
